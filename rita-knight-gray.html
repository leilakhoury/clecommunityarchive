            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp;When I moved back to Cleveland from L.A., after
            leaving Kent and my mother’s death, I wasn’t in the right place. I
            decided, since I had graduated in film, I was going to try to get
            into television. I had worked at
            <a class="body-link" href="https://karamuhouse.org/" target="_blank"
              >Karamu</a
            >
            as a volunteer, so I did a lot of work in theater. Lighting was my
            thing. So I decided to go out to L.A. because I wanted to become a
            best boy; A best boy is either a best boy electric or a best boy
            prop or grip. It works directly with the director of photography and
            the lighting person, if you’re doing the lighting, which I wanted to
            do. The best boy comes up with ideas and examples. For example, if
            the director wanted to shoot in a corner—and it’s kinda hard to
            shoot in a corner—the best boy would come up with lighting that
            would get decent amount of light, not create shadows, and save what
            the director wanted. That’s what a best boy is, it’s a
            problem-solver.
          </p>
          <p>
            I went out to California and I did a lot of lighting and worked with
            some private companies. When I got ready to get into the studio, I
            had my gloves ready, had my wrench and all my shoes and everything
            was ready, I got a call that the actors were going on strike. And it
            would have taken them five years to get back to where they would be
            calling me, and I didn’t have five years. I started late in school,
            my mother was sick, so I was doing that and trying to go to school,
            along with the money. So I started late in school, and was later
            even still after the
            <a

              >May 4th shooting.</a
            >

            I didn’t want to wait around for five years to maybe get called to
            work in a studio, so I left California in 1984 or 1985 and came back
            to Cleveland and decided to be a videographer.

            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp; At that time, trying to seek out the lesbian and
            gay situations in Cleveland was… interesting. It was somewhat
            similar to L.A., but not really. I remember that most gay men had
            the money and the power, so a lot of restaurants and bars were
            geared toward gay men. Women didn’t have too many bars. Out of
            twenty gay men’s bars there might have been four lesbian bars, and
            maybe one of them was suitable for Black people. The reason why I
            say that is the music and everything else. If you wanted to dance,
            you want to go somewhere that plays real good house music or music
            that’s continuous so you dance until you sweat, and you take things
            out of your brain, and it takes you to another location. But there
            weren’t that many bars, and the bars that were here seemed to
            disappear. In most cases, Black gay men and lesbians mostly partied
            or went to bars that were just one-size-fits-all, because there were
            not that many Black bars. So the Black bars were primarily both men
            and women, and that’s where you got your enjoyment. But you always
            wanted to find something else. I mean, I can call myself a
            renaissance person because I’m always dipping into everything… I
            don’t just confine myself to one thing. Because if something’s good
            in one thing, I’ll take that. If it’s not, I’ll move onto something
            else.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Sistahparty came about, it was started for that reason; to get
            together and talk about different things, along with trying to start
            things up, maybe having groups to discuss things that’s going on in
            the community, making sure that we fit in the community, and
            everything else you can think of. And it was a good thing, because
            people showed up. The first meeting was only a small cluster, but
            when word had gotten around and we held the next meeting, there were
            almost 75 people in one house. It was basically a potluck and
            everybody brought something, and we sat around and discussed this
            and that. It was a really good, uplifting thing at the time. And it
            was doing pretty well!
          </p>
          <p>
            There were Black clubs like the 
                        <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://www.facebook.com/The8ballclub/"
              target="_blank"
              >The Eightball Club</a
            > and a couple others.
            They would throw parties which you’d buy a ticket and raffle, and it
            was a BYO-party, or something like that. And that was a good thing.
            I myself was only trying to go out dancing when I went out. And that
            was just me, because I loved to dance and that was my exercise. That
            was my tension reliever. When you have stress, you go dance. So I’d
            do that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sistahparty was going great, and we were trying to move ahead. We
            were even trying to think about getting a place and starting another
            type of bar-like, party center-like thing. Petrarca was the bar that
            most Black gays and lesbians went to. The building that it was in
            was getting ready to shut down and tear down the place, so we’re
            getting ready to lose that. The only thing that did come about was
            another bar called Keys, which was similar. There was also Isis,
            which was pretty good, but it only got better in the evenings. But
            like I said, Sistahparty had to do what it did. We tried to keep it
            going.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think it was the time that Mistinguette was getting ready to
            either go back to school or move to Massachusetts—she was the person
            who was the president so to speak, if you want to put a title on it.
            She was getting ready to leave and she was changing her mind because
            there were other things she wanted to get involved with. So another
            set of people took over. I was working with some of those people and
            the one thing we did was we decided to have a retreat. We got
            together at a Unitarian church out in Lake County, near Mentor. They
            had property in the back, and we could use their kitchen and
            everything, because Faye [one of the Sistahparty members] knew the
            person in charge or the person who did the programing. So they came
            up with everything in regards to that. We had a kitchen, we had
            food, and we had places where we could form groups and everything.
            That was our last thing. We had speakers come in and talk about
            financing, health, and other things that were great for us. So we
            did that, and it was success. But unfortunately, that was the last
            Sistahparty, because from there, it didn’t go anywhere and nobody
            was coming up with any ideas. So it sorta kinda died in a sense. But
            it was a great thing that happened, I wish it did go on.

          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp; Other things started happening because the gay
            community, in a sense, is almost like how society is. There are
            differences between gay men and what they’re able to do, and
            differences in lesbians and what they’re not able to do
            community-wise. And to me, it shows because the various things that
            have been able to succeed have basically been what the gay men have
            put together. A lot of Black people felt that they were really out
            of things. Black Gay Pride was one group, and Blackout was another.
            And I started it with a friend of mine that I grew to know when I
            was working at the law school library at Case, and he was a law
            student. He and one of his friends wanted to do something that would
            be a little bit different from what Gay Pride did. But for some
            reason, I think the things that they did were a little bit
            over-the-top and would only be sufficient enough for people who were
            over-the-top. People that were your usual everyday folk looked at it
            as something that wasn’t really for them. They sorta lost some
            people from that too. And then there was the battle with Black Gay
            Pride and the names that were called… it just got ridiculous. So
            Black Gay Pride lasted for a minute, then it changed over, and it
            died. Of course Pride was still around, but the way that it was
            formed was different. People would carry it on, so to speak.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was the whole situation in the city of Cleveland. Not to say
            that I didn’t want to associate with white lesbians, no, that wasn’t
            the case. It was just that there were things that I wanted to do.
            Going to a country western bar is okay for a moment, but I can’t
            dance the way I want to dance to house music. You know what I’m
            saying. I’ll go to a country western bar and I’ll enjoy myself, but
            when it comes time for me to get the stress out and just to dance,
            lose some weight, whatever, that wasn’t happening. That was the
            changes that was goin’ on. I mean, one time I went to a gay male
            bar, and I didn’t know it was a leather bar, and I had on the wrong
            pair of shoes so I couldn’t get in. Which I was wearing clogs, I
            don’t understand that, but hey [laughs].

          <br />
          <p><b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;Those were still really exclusionary spaces.</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp;I tried, but it didn’t work. Like I said, those
            were good ideas. It’s just that a lot of people had life that they
            wanted to carry on, or things they wanted to do, or they did things
            the other way. People would have house parties, but you know, after
            a while it couldn’t be the place that you could go when you’re
            sitting around for a week or two and say ‘I wanna go dance.’ That
            was the brains of what was trying to be done, or trying to create,
            but some people weren’t going in that direction. Other people were
            talking about the Eightball Club and the other couple of clubs that
            started up. These just didn’t last, and they dissipated, and people
            held on as long as they could, but a lot of things changed. It would
            be nice to start up something like that, but I don’t think there’s
            too many people that would be interested in it.

            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp; I was talking to Mistinguette, and I was telling
            her that after Sistahparty had changed with other people being in
            charge, supposedly Leslie Huff [lawyer and former member of
            Sistahparty] had donated some of the Sistahparty paperwork to East
            Cleveland’s
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://eastclevelandpubliclibrary.org/icabod-flewellen-collection/"
              target="_blank"
              >Flewellen Collection.</a
            >
            But I don’t think they even got a deed, because that was after I
            left. They were doing things wrong when it came to getting things
            like a notarized deed, that the person had turned over the
            paperwork, should you get the paperwork, all of those things from
            above. So I’ll have to check with them, cause I haven’t been back to
            East Cleveland because they’ve been changing everything in regards
            to his collection. Which pisses me off, because I could have
            finished it five years ago if they would have let me finish it. But
            nobody wants to listen, nobody knows the difference between a museum
            and an archive. So trying to explain what archiving is to people
            that didn’t want to listen and only wanted to go in the direction
            that they thought they knew, so they wanted me to be the librarian,
            I just wanted to be the archivist, and I understand it was because
            of the money situation. But you promised, Mr. Flewellen, that you
            would have it accessible to people, and that’s what I was doing. But
            then you left it high and dry. That’s where I was with that and that
            whole situation.

              >When I spoke with Mistinguette,</a
            > that part
            of the story stuck with me. You had put forth all this effort to
            create a space to serve your community. And to trust an institution
            to preserve the documentation of that space, only to have them
            erased, is beyond devastating. As Mistinguette said, it’s
            devastating to younger generations.

          <br />
          <p>
            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp;That is the biggest thing. And it’s not only just
            the gay community, it’s also the Black community. When you don’t
            have a stable Black community, it’s not helpful. Here’s my one
            statement and I tell this to everyone: Everybody is connected.
            Everything, whatever you can think of, is connected. And when you
            tear apart the connection, it doesn’t succeed to any points. It
            doesn’t help anyone at all. Have you, in a sense, ran across
            information like the story that I’m telling, about the difference in
            the gay community, and the breakdown within the community?

          <br />
          <p>
            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;Yes. Another comparable space within this project
            is Bounce. That was one of the few remaining trans-inclusive,
            BIPOC-inclusive spaces in the area surrounding Detroit and 29th.
            That’s the most recent example that I know of. By most accounts gay
            nightlife in Cleveland is historically whitewashed. And today, very
            much assimilated into conventionally straight venues.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp;And conventionally gay-male venues. You go down to
            Gordon Square and all of that, all of those are owned by gay white
            men. Gay Black men are accepted, but in a lot of cases Black
            lesbians aren’t. Some go, and some don’t because it isn’t what they
            would really want to have, in that sense.
          </p>

            California was not as bad [in the 1980’s-onward]; there were quite a
            few bars that were female bars, and a few that were mixed, but
            primarily female. When I went to visit a friend in New York, that
            was the case there too. There weren’t too many gay bars. It was
            almost the same way in Cleveland, which I thought was really weird,
            because I thought New York would have more. My friend would take me
            to this bar, and it would be this teeny tiny bar, and you had to go
            in in shifts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Twiggy’s, I believe, also started a bar here way back when. Those
            were all-inclusive, didn’t matter if you were gay or straight, Black
            or white. They played great house music, it was in a major
            warehouse, and it was packed with people. And that seemed to be what
            was taking place: bars such as that, all-inclusive. If you were
            straight, good. If you just like the music and go to dance, fine.
            And they had drag shows and everything else. That’s what I remember
            during that time, from the 90’s on.

            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp;I have two projects, I just finished one. I went
            down to the first march in Cleveland, wore my mask and kept my
            distance, and made a video. It’s on YouTube. It’s called
            <a

          </p>
          <p>
            I got another project that I’ve been working on, which is about the
            area I live in, which is on the other side of Glenville—on the other
            side of University Circle. But it was never called Glenville, it was
            never part of Glenville until Ward 9 put them all together. People
            would say, ‘You’re from Ward 9, you represent Glenville,’ which, no,
            we weren’t. I found that out when I came back to Cleveland in 1985,
            ‘cause I always thought we were. But when I came back, they were
            supposed to be helping all the east side Black neighborhoods with
            initiatives and grants and everything. At that time, Home Health Aid
            was just beginning, so the Red Cross was giving people the books and
            uniforms so you could get the certificate and everything. And that
            was open for free to all the people in the neighborhoods that they
            were helping. I always like to extend my skills, so I went to apply
            as a Glenville resident. And when I told them, they told me that I
            wasn’t part of Glenville. That’s the reason why this area that I
            live in has been stagnant. That’s in the video too.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s what I’m working on, in telling the story from the very
            beginning. That it’s not Glenville, and what has happened to it.
            Coronavirus started and everything else changed, and the Mayor’s
            initiative came about, and right now on my street there are fifteen
            brand new houses. But as far as creating a market or marketable area
            on Superior, there isn’t any. So I keep asking the question, is this
            still the dream? We will build it, they will come? Along with tax
            abatement, which I got really upset about that, because I didn’t
            want my taxes to go up...
            <br /><br />[My phone call with Rita unexpectedly drops]<br /><br />
            [I call back, Rita answers]<br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp;Yeah, I think sometimes they don’t like you to
            talk on the phone too long.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;Sorry about that Rita, I’m not sure what happened
            there.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp;Yeah that happens, it’s been happening ever since
            the pandemic [laughs]. Anyway, that’s what I’m working on. And I’ve
            been working on this ever since the 1990’s. I finally went out and
            shot some stuff, but I’ve gotta do some more interviews and shoot
            some more. And now, this ending is kinda good because it gives me
            the opportunity to put things together and ask the question in the
            end, what will happen? So that’s what I’m working on.
