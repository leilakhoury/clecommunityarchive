            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp;I attended Kent State University September, 1979 two years after graduating from high school. In 1979 on

              target="_blank"
              >May 4th,</a
            > the protest against the Vietnam War reached Kent where four students leaving class were shot dead. The school closed and I decided that it would be better to return home, work, buy a car to have independence, and maybe attend Cleveland State University.  
			</p>
			<p>Cleveland State proved to be a problem since those in charge decided to make the school into an elitist university. I was told that because of my grades it would be better for me to attend Cuyahoga Community College (Tri-C).  That was an insult as I tried to explain that I was a freshman but I was also the age of a junior and I knew what was needed. They were not having it actually didn’t really care that is when I decided to return to Kent in four years 1974 and graduate in 1977.</p>
			<p>I started volunteering at 
			 <a class="body-link" href="https://karamuhouse.org/" target="_blank"
              >Karamu</a> after graduating doing lighting and stage production while working at various temporary office jobs in and around the Cleveland area.  Even though I graduated with a BS degree in Radio, Television and Theater I wasn’t sure I wouldn’t be able to obtain a job in those fields along with the death of my mother and the great blizzards of 1977-78 I felt there was the need for a change. So I decided to move to L.A. and become a best boy.  A best boy is either a best boy electric or a Best Boy grip. I wanted to be a Best Boy electric/Lighting so that I could problem solve lighting problems brought about by the Director’s shot selection.   </p>
			
			<p>After arriving in LA in 1980 I began working at the University of Southern California Science Library where I made connections with people working at the university as well as working with independent lighting and event planning companies.</p>

            <big><i>Placemaking Through Sistahparty</i></big>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp; At that time, trying to seek out the Lesbian and gay situations in Cleveland was… interesting. It was somewhat similar in size to L.A.  I remember that most gay men had the money and the power, so a lot of restaurants and bars were geared toward gay men. Women didn’t have too many bars. Out of the many gay men’s bars there might have been 1/3 of the Lesbian bars, and maybe one of them was suitable for Black gays and Lesbians.  I say that because If you wanted to dance, you want to go somewhere that played real good house music or music that’s continuous so you dance until you sweat, get into the beat and clear your mind so you are taken somewhere else. But there weren’t that many bars.  The bars that were here seemed to slowly disappear. In most cases, Black gay men and Lesbians mostly partied at Petrarca a hole in the wall on Petrarca Avenue a one-size-fits-all for Black gays and Lesbians.  But you always wanted to find something else, different. I mean, I can call myself a renaissance person because I’m always dipping into everything… I don’t just confine myself to one thing because if something’s good in one thing, I’ll take that. If it’s not, I’ll move onto something else.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Sistahparty came about, it was started for that reason; to get
            together and talk about different things, along with trying to start
            things up, maybe having groups to discuss things that’s going on in
            the community, making sure that we fit in the community, and
            everything else you can think of. And it was a good thing, because
            people showed up. The first meeting was only a small cluster, but
            when word had gotten around and we held the next meeting, there were
            almost 75 people in one house. It was basically a potluck and
            everybody brought something, and we sat around and discussed this
            and that. It was a really good, uplifting thing at the time. And it
            was doing pretty well!
          </p>
          <p>
            There were Black clubs like the 
                        <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://www.facebook.com/The8ballclub/"
              target="_blank"
              >The Eightball Club</a
            > and a couple others. They would throw BYO parties which you’d buy a ticket for raffles a good thing. I was only trying to go out dancing when I went out. And that was just me, because I loved to dance and that was my exercise. That was my tension reliever. When you have stress, you go dance. So I’d do that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sistahparty was going great, and we were trying to move ahead. We were even trying to think about getting a place and starting another type of bar-like, party center-like thing. Petrarca was the bar that most Black gays and Lesbians went to. The building that it was in was getting ready to shut down and be torn down so were getting ready to lose it. The only thing that did come about was another bar called Keys, which was similar. There was also Isis a Lesbian bar downtown, which was pretty good, but it only got better in the evening after 10 pm. But like I said, Sistahparty had to do what it did. We tried to keep it going.
          </p>
          <p>
		  I think it was the time that Mistinguette was getting ready to either go back to school or move to Massachusetts—she was the person who was the president so to speak, if you want to put a title on it. She was getting ready to leave and she was changing her mind because there were other things she wanted to get involved with. So another set of people took over. I was working with some of those people and the one thing we did was we decided to have a retreat. We got together at a Unitarian church out in Lake County, near Mentor. They had property in the back, and we could use their kitchen and everything, because Faye [one of the Sistahparty members] knew the person in charge or the person who did the programming. So they came up with everything in regards to that. We had a kitchen, we had food, and we had places where we could form groups and everything. That was our last thing. We had speakers come in and talk about financing, health, and other things that were great for us. So we did that, and it was success. But unfortunately, that was the last Sistahparty, because from there, it didn’t go anywhere and nobody was coming up with any ideas. So it sorta kinda died in a sense. But it was a great thing that happened, I wish it did go on.

          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp;Other things started happening because the gay community, in a sense, is almost like how society is. There are differences between gay men and what they’re able to do, and differences in Lesbians and what they’re not able to do community-wise. And to me, it shows because the various things that have been able to succeed have basically been what the gay men have put together. A lot of Black people felt that they were really out of things. Black Gay Pride was one group, and Blackout was another. And I started it with a friend of mine that I grew to know when I was working at the law school library at Case, a law student.  He and one of his friends wanted to do something that would be a little bit different from what Gay Pride did. But for some reason, I think the things that they did were a little bit over-the-top and would only be sufficient enough for people who were over-the-top. People that were your usual everyday folk looked at it as something that wasn’t really for them. They sorta lost some people from that too. And then there was the battle with Black Gay Pride and the names that were called… it just got ridiculous. So Black Out lasted for a minute, then it changed over, and I believe they combined. People would carry it on, so to speak.
          </p>
          <p>
		  That was the whole situation in the city of Cleveland. Not to say that I didn’t want to associate with white Lesbians, no, that wasn’t the case. It was just that there were things that I wanted to do. Going to a country western bar is okay for a moment, but I can’t dance the way I want to dance to house music. You know what I’m saying. I’ll go to a country western bar and I’ll enjoy myself, but when it comes time for me to get the stress out and just dance, lose some weight, whatever, that wasn’t happening that ware the changes that was goin’ on.  I mean, one time I went to a gay male bar, and I didn’t know it was a leather bar, and I had on the wrong pair of shoes so I couldn’t get in. Which I was wearing clogs, I don’t understand that, but hey [laughs].

          <br />
          <p><b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;Those were still really exclusionary spaces.</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp;I tried, but it didn’t work. Like I said, those were good ideas. It’s just that a lot of people had life that they wanted to carry on, or things they wanted to do, or they did things the other way. People would have house parties, but you know, after a while it couldn’t be the place that you could go when you’re sitting around for a week or two and say ‘I wanna go dance.’ That was the brains of what was trying to be done, or trying to create, but some people weren’t going in that direction. Other people were talking about the Eightball Club and the other couple of clubs that started up. These just didn’t last not sure, and I believed dissipated, and people held on as long as they could, but a lot of things changed. It would be nice to start up something like that, but I don’t think there are too many people that would be interested in it.

            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp; I was talking to Mistinguette, and I was telling
            her that after Sistahparty had changed with other people being in
            charge, supposedly Leslie Huff [lawyer and former member of
            Sistahparty] had donated some of the Sistahparty paperwork to East
            Cleveland where the
            <a

              href="https://eastclevelandpubliclibrary.org/icabod-flewellen-collection/"

              >Flewellen Collection</a
            >
            is kept. But I don’t think they even got a deed, it was after I
            left. They were doing things wrong when it came to getting things like a notarized deed for donated material that a person turns over to be archived.  So I’ll have to check with them, because I haven’t been back to East Cleveland library they’ve been changing everything in regards to the Flewellen Collection, which pisses me off, because I could have finished it five years ago if they would have let me finish it. But nobody wants to listen nobody knows the difference between a museum and an archive. So trying to explain what archiving is to people that didn’t want to listen and only wanted to go in the direction that they thought they knew, so they wanted me to be the librarian, I just wanted to be the archivist, and I understand it was because of the money situation. But you promised, Mr. Flewellen, that you would have it accessible to people, and that’s what I was doing. But then you left it high and dry. That’s where I was with that and that whole situation.

              >When I spoke with Mistinguette,</a
            > that part
            of the story stuck with me. You had put forth all this effort to
            create a space to serve your community. And to trust an institution
            to preserve the documentation of that space, only to have them
            erased, is beyond devastating. As Mistinguette said, it’s
            devastating to younger generations.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp;That is the biggest thing. And it’s not only just the gay community, it’s also the Black community. When you don’t have a stable Black community, it’s not helpful. Here’s my one statement and I tell this to everyone: Everybody is connected. Everything, whatever you can think of, is connected. And when you tear apart the connection, it doesn’t succeed to any points. It doesn’t help anyone at all. Have you, in a sense, ran across information like the story that I’m telling, about the difference in the gay community, and the breakdown within the community?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;Yes. Another comparable space within this project
            is Bounce. That was one of the few remaining trans-inclusive,
            BIPOC-inclusive spaces in the area surrounding Detroit and 29th.
            That’s the most recent example that I know of. By most accounts gay
            nightlife in Cleveland is historically whitewashed. And today, very
            much assimilated into conventionally straight venues.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>RITA:</b>&emsp;And conventionally gay-male venues. You go down to Gordon Square and all of that, all of those are owned by gay white men. Gay Black men are accepted, but in a lot of cases Black Lesbians aren’t. Some go, and some don’t because it isn’t what they would really want to have/do, in that sense.
          </p>
          <p>California was not as bad [in the 1980’s-onward]; there were quite a few bars that were female bars, and a few that were mixed, but primarily female. When I went to visit a friend in New York, that was the case there too. There weren’t too many Lesbian bars. It was almost the same way in Cleveland, which I thought was really weird, because I thought New York would have more. My friend would take me to this bar, and it would be this teeny tiny bar, and you had to enter in shifts.
          </p>
          <p>Twiggy’s in DC, I believe, also started a bar here way back when. Those were all-inclusive, didn’t matter if you were gay or straight, Black or white. They played great house music, it was in a major warehouse, and it was packed with people. And that seemed to be what was taking place: bars such as that, all-inclusive. If you were straight, good. If you just like the music and go to dance, fine. And they had drag shows and everything else. That’s what I remember during that time, from the 90’s on.

          <p>
		  I got another project that I’ve been working on, which is about the area I live in, which is on the other side of Glenville—on the other side of University Circle. But it never called Glenville, it was never part of Glenville until Ward 9 put them all together. People would say, ‘You’re from Ward 9, you represented Glenville,’ which, no, we weren’t. I found that out when I came back to Cleveland in 1985, ‘cause I always thought we were. But when I came back, they were supposed to be helping all the east side Black neighborhoods with initiatives and grants and everything. At that time, Home Health Aid was just beginning, so the Red Cross was giving people the books and uniforms so you could get the certificate and everything. And that was open for free to all the people in the neighborhoods that they were helping. I always like to extend my skills, so I went to apply as a Glenville resident. And when I told them, they told me that I wasn’t part of Glenville. That’s the reason why this area that I live in has been stagnant. That’s in the video too.
          </p>
          <p>
		  That’s what I’m working on, telling the story from the very beginning. That it’s not Glenville, and what has happened to it. Coronavirus started and everything else changed, the Mayor’s initiative came about, and right now on my street there are fifteen brand new houses. But as far as creating a market or marketable area on Superior, there isn’t any. So I keep asking the question, is this still the dream? We will build it, they will come? Along with tax abatements, which I got really upset about because I didn’t want my taxes to go up...

I finally went out and shot some stuff, but I’ve gotta do some more interviews and shoot some more. And now, this ending is kinda good because it gives me the opportunity to put things together and ask the question in the end, what will happen? So that’s what I’m working on.
