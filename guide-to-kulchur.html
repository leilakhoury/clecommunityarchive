            space; as a kid, my aunt had them, so she gave them to me. I always
            wanted to have those spaces. The very first time I tried to organize
            something like that was called [?] Arts, and it was a writers’
            intensive. For nine weeks we would study something, we would try to
            attempt to be real rigorous about the study of one thing. We had

            in Tremont, and I met Erin Kray. She had this gallery called
            Inside-Outside Gallery. She didn’t own it, some weirdo owned it, but
            she ran it, and she was doing crazy shit. She had a

            drawing show there, she had a street artist named Swoon up in there.
            A lot of cool happenings. And she invited me to use the back room to
            make a record store/bookstore called Viva Libre. So we did it, and
            it was goin’ alright, we were doing shows there and we had a nice
            thing going. But the weirdo that owned the place sexually harassed
            Erin, or something happened weird. She wanted to sell it eventually,
            but we got kicked out of there.

            <b>RA:</b>&emsp; There was a Spanish church across the street. It
            was painted all white with a red door. And inside it was completely
            red; carpet, ceiling, it had the most dank red carpet. And we turned
            that into the Church of Ayler. We had a curatorial staff made up of

            was a part of it, like all these guys before any of us really had
            anything going. We just knew what was happening. We had Dan Deacon
            play a show before he blew. We had Sunburned Hand of the Man. We had
            Magic Markers, we had Lightning Bolt, it was just this crazy space.
            And every show was super packed, it was hot as fuck in there, and we
            paid the bands 100% at the door. We had it worked out so if you came
            to our shows, you’d have a little discount at the corner store—it
            was right here on the corner of 14th and Auburn. We did that for
            like maybe 19 months and then we got in trouble with the city. We
            had some underage drinking tickets and that began the beginning of
            me catching significant consequences for DIY action. So I kinda
            chilled off it for a while.

            <b>RA:</b>&emsp; In 2013 I was working at this French fusion bistro
            that had, like, risotto cakes made of Brussel Sprouts and weirdo
            shit, and the chef thought of himself as a poet, and I was his sous
            chef. I liked the job because we had this lunch service and nobody
            would come, so it would just be me and him chopping it up. I wrote

            one of my novels, at that bar, right there while doing the lunch
            shift. I worked a lunch shift and then we’d transition to dinner, so
            I’d be there like 15 hours a day and it was great—I had something to
            do, I could leave it there, I had money, I was writing, it was fine.
            Something happened with those guys… I was supposed to go on this
            honeymoon vacation with Dr. Bly so I requested time off, and they
            said, “Cool no worries you can have your job when you come back, we
            got it covered.” We get to the airport and she can’t get on the
            plane because her passport is like one month from being expired. So
            we cancel everything. I call work that same day like, “Hey I could
            work tonight,” and they’re like, “Yeah… we moved in another
            direction. Come pick up your check.” I went and got my check, it was
            $915.75 after taxes. I’m sitting there at the Gypsy Bean Coffee Shop
            and I’m looking across the street from Capitol Theatre and I’m like
            damn, I gotta come back home and tell her no we’re not going on the
            trip, I don’t have this job anymore. I wasn’t looking forward to
            doing it.

            I see this empty storefront, and the sign says
            <i>Available For Rent</i> with a phone number. I take a picture of
            it, and on the drive home thinking, “Man, don’t I have a business
            plan about a bookstore in my files or something?” Get home, find the
            old Viva Libre bookstore plan, find this poster I made for a one-off
            magazine I called Guide to Kulchur. There was one issue. The

            had work in it, it had vellum covers, it was pretty dope. We were
            proud of it, we just couldn’t muster enough effort to get another
            issue, but I loved the name. I called it Guide to Kulchur and I
            started choppin’ it with Dr. Bly. They added the zine archive, got a
            press, boom boom boom. And we just started rocking Guide to Kulchur
            like that.

            About a year into it, our marriage was falling apart, and the last
            thing she told me she was like, “If you don’t get some people to
            help you do this, we’re getting a divorce.” The only people who were
            around were these anarchist kids that threw a book fair at Guide to
            Kulchur—a really successful one. They brought all these West Coast
            anarchists, all these East Coast anarchists, there were talks and
            shit. It was dope. Well organized, well done, and I was like, “Man
            these guys down here, maybe I’ll ask them.” So we start talking
            about it being a co-op and somebody had heard a presentation from
            Kent State about the Commonwealth Cooperative Loan Fund. So we got
            in touch with those guys and began the process of becoming a co-op.
            It took us about two years to get the funding, but in the meantime,
            we did, I don’t know, 430 events in a year. The writeups were good,
            we got some support from the Cleveland Artist Work Fellowship, they
            gave us $20,000 and we spent it on

            this phenomenal facilitator and all-around super-being. There were
            like 300 people in there. And the police were surrounding the
            bookstore and national media was there… it was a little bit of a
            circus. We built a coalition, we brought council members down in the
            basement, it was in the Washington Post, and people started to
            peacock and vie for who was going to be the next Fred Hampton. Some
            people were even doubling down on the archetype of Moses, like, “I’m
            gonna get you to the Promised Land.” And I’m like, that didn’t work
            out for the dude though [laughs]. It was just a wild scene man, we
            kept to our principles. We weren’t trying to lead anything, we were
            just service-oriented. We printed all the flyers, we used our
            resources to get refreshments for the meetings, we provided the
            space. We printed stuff for them to sell, you know.

            Black Lives Matter had a convention in Cleveland, and they listed us
            as an ally space, but not as a Black space. They said that it was a
            cult of white guys, but the owner was Black, so you can get some
            free resources. That’s what it said in the brochure. And I was like
            man that’s crazy. We had that dynamic too. Cause if you come up to a
            building and you see like sixteen crust punk white dudes sitting
            there tattooed up, dusty ass doc martins—you know the kind—that we
            always fall in love with, because we think they might play guitar
            well, or they might actually believe in the poetry they write and
            shit… They really know how to blink, it’s like their thing, they
            blink at you… So you know, Black folks weren’t trying to come around
            there. It just wasn’t an intersectional space. And anytime I tried
            to bring in Black folks that were radical, it would just always go
            sideways. So that was a dynamic. We really wasn’t getting any East
            Side love, but we was up in the West Side. That’s when I started
            being like man, it kinda feels like I’m a West Side mammy. Like an
            anarchist, crust punk mammy. I like the music and I get along with
            the people, and I got tattoos, I like cocaine, you know that kinda
            vibe. I dunno man, I just felt like I was over-extended.

            group that we would pay each other instead of hiring a sales manager
            to build the press, so we could be more sustainable. We had all
            these projections, but we didn’t factor in the sales manager. Like I
            could get gigs, but I couldn’t get someone on commission or salary.
            But we didn’t use our money that way. We just paid each other $1500

            and I’m on NPR, and I’m feeling the cult of personality of it. I’m
            like, <i>yeah, finally shining, a me type vibe.</i> But you can
            distort a thing when you want something from it. Or you haven’t
            really considered what’s gonna make it sustainable for you.

            So that was going on. We started a record store called Young Kings
            in Hingetown. We made a deal with the developers, got the space, but
            didn’t even really hammer out what it would be like. We basically
            had to build it out, all the infrastructure in the space, and pay
            rent. It didn’t take off because we couldn’t finish the buildout. We
            were literally a shop without lights at night, no power. Couldn’t
            play music in there, there’s no power! And people were looking at me
            like, “What the fuck are you doing,” but I didn’t care. Fred Bidwell
            comes in like, ‘why are you doing all this non-profity shit. You
            should just be a non-profit.’ He’s like, ‘Look… if you organize a
            nonprofit out here, I’ll introduce you to the foundations.’ I was
            like, bet.

            and all that. So I went on his website, I looked at his mission
            statement, I found some Ezra Pound writing that I liked that was in
            Guide to Kulchur, and I just kinda blended an amalgamation of it,
            made a brochure with the print shop, brought it to him, and he was
            true to his word. Next thing I know I was meeting with Cleveland
            Foundation, Gund Foundation, you know what I mean? And it’s up! I
            got a board, started rocking, we file, but we can’t get our sea legs
            under us. This is the third move we’ve had, and we just can’t muster
            it. And I can’t do like 90 hours anymore. Six months in I come to
            them and I’m like, “Hey man, you know, I think I need to step down.”
            But I didn’t come clean, I didn’t say “I’m sick,” or “I need some
            help,” I just was like, trying to game the president of the board by
            saying, “hey it’s time for <i>you</i> to shine.” I wasn’t
            transparent, so I didn’t get the result I wanted. So I stayed on,
            and it then it just became a shit show. We got a strategic planning
            grant and I misused the funds from it… like $3,500 of it. I misused
            some private donations. They found out, they fired me, and that was
            pretty much the end of Guide to Kulchur.
          </p>

            Now it just sits in this nebulous space of like, ‘Oh what a messy
            project.’ I mean, I think people think it was good, but at the same
            time, so embarrassingly messy. That’s the extent of actual physical
            spaces. You know, we started
            <a

            for a similar premise. We weren’t trying to be a record label per
            se, we we’re just trying to put some of our own records out. And
            it’s probably been the longest thing I’ve ever been up to, out of
            something like 50 different artist projects.

            On November 6th we’re gonna premier a 5-part docuseries with live
            music and whole lotta other special things called The Mourning [A]
            BLKstar Residencies. It’s gonna premier on the Black Blur Streaming
            platform. Also, two of my novels are in pre-production to become
            films. So I’m doin’ a lot of script-revising and getting to ask
            questions that make me feel uncomfortable about what they’re about
            to do to my book. It’s an interesting time to be alive because you
            could literally make anything now. You don’t really need pro tools.
            You don’t really need the things they tell you that you need in
            school. It will be interesting to see what happens, right?

            <b>RA:</b>&emsp; I just wanted to say an aside for the people that
            worked at Guide to Kulchur, and worked on the board, and worked in
            the co-op, and any people that were affiliated with it: What an
            amazing group of individuals that were committed to cooperative work
            and, you know, really should be applauded for taking the risk that
            we did as a group, and really should be celebrated, and feel proud
            of the work. I hope that one day the way we all show up in the world
            can lead to people really looking at that period of time in a
            positive light, and hopefully I can walk back some of the stain and
            my own personal shortcomings that I brought to it. But if I cannot do
            that, I’m hoping that some concept of restorative justice and the
            balance and nuance in how we tell stories may show up. And I hope
            that this archive project can add some of that to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have to be mindful of the thigs that we commit to, of course, but
            we have to also understand that within a capitalist frame, if you’re
            an artist, you’re gonna be asked to do a lot of social service work.
            Are you supposed to be doing it? Is that something that your soul
            needs to be doing? Do you understand what that commitment takes for
            your personal resources? We need to make things more sustainable,
            and we need to cycle through leadership in those situations. Maybe
            on a nine-month or six-month cycle, where someone acts as the
            facilitator for the conversations, and you change that voice. Those
            are the things I learned about doing this project.
          </p>
          <p>
            And to all the people that decided that it was smart to build a cult
            of personality around a very willing, and very
            external-validation-seeking, marginalized person: I would just like
            to say that what happened with that $3,500 was egregious, sure, but
            it got paid back. No one ever came back and said, you know, ‘You
            meant this to me; You did this.’ They just left me languishing in an
            inability to work in a city that I gave my whole heart to. So I’m in
            a place now where I’m trying to figure out, do I say <i>fuck this
            fucking city?</i> Or do I accept the beating and hopefully stay
            courageous enough to not be afraid of the smoke and really own the
            work—the good and the bad of it? Maybe it can help inform another
            opportunity like that later down the line.

            Aight. This was RA Washington, co-founder of Guide to Kulchur: Text,
            Art, and News. We put on over 700 events over the course of six
            years and we put out 35 books, including the first books by and for
            Black women writers. A lot of the people that worked there are still
            artists, and still making the same or even greater contributions to
            this society. I feel very proud of how they were able to take the
            information that they learned from Guide to Kulchur and make
            something new that was informed by some of the mishaps and the bad
            strategy of that. I feel positive about that, and I feel pretty
            confident that I will never be a part of a DIY situation again.
