          <p>
            <b>MISTINGUETTE:</b>&emsp;I was born in what used to be called City
            Hospital, I think it’s now Metro Health Hospital, in Cleveland, Ohio
            in October 1961. I’m a native Clevelander, and I started to be
            involved with the LGBT community mostly through feminist
            organizations. In the mid-1970’s and early-1980’s, the women’s
            movement in Cleveland was very strong, and many of those
            institutions were led by lesbians. When I was still in high school
            in the late 1970’s, I was very involved with the Cleveland Free
            Clinic. It was very much an alternative space, it wasn’t entirely
            about healthcare, it was also a space where people were
            experimenting with new ways of living and what we would call equity
            today. That connected me to some other institutions. There was an
            organization called
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://case.edu/ech/articles/w/womenspace"
              target="_blank"
              >WomenSpace,</a
            >
            which was a hotline, information center, and meeting space for
            women’s organizing, much of which was lesbian-led. They were the
            original home of the
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://clevelandrapecrisis.org/"
              target="_blank"
              >The Cleveland Rape Crisis Center,</a
            >
            where I was once a volunteer. I would say that in those days,
            probably 60% of the volunteers at the Rape Crisis Center were
            lesbians. In that time period, what it meant to be a lesbian was to
            put women at the center of your lives. It wasn’t just a sexual
            orientation; it was a political orientation around gender. I worked
            at the battered women’s shelter, which at the time was called
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://case.edu/ech/articles/c/center-prevention-domestic-violence"
              target="_blank"
              >Women Together.</a
            >
            Interestingly, it later changed its name to The Center for the
            Prevention of Domestic Violence because there was a period in the
            domestic violence movement where lesbians were purged. The board of
            that organization decided that the name and the logo, which was
            three stylized women’s bodies under a roof, looked a little too much
            like lesbians. So that’s my initial context for LGBT Cleveland. And
            these community spaces were overwhelmingly white. But they were very
            powerful institutions.

            <big><i>Bars + Sets</i></big>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>MISTINGUETTE:</b>&emsp; THE lesbian bar was Isis, which we
            jokingly called Crisis, because there <i>always</i> was one
            [laughs]. And it was very much like lesbian bars of the 1950’s.
            There was a cop outside, there was a little narrow window that they
            looked at you through, you had to pay to get in, and if you were a
            Person of Color, you probably had to pay more to get in. There was a
            limit to how many Black people were allowed inside at a time, or the
            place would—as they said then—tilt. And when you walked in the bar
            it was very dark, all the walls were painted black, and there would
            always be a group of women sitting at the bar in the front, often
            Black and Latinx women, in fancy dresses. I later came to understand
            that those were women who lived straight lives and being at this bar
            was an outlet for them. There was always a knife fight or some crazy
            drunken brawl that happened, because that’s what happens when
            people’s internalized homophobia is loosened by large quantities of
            alcohol and they’re packed in a tight space without air
            conditioning. That was my experience with the bar scene, and I’m
            sure other people had very different experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m not someone who drinks alcohol much, I was not looking for a
            partner, and it wasn’t attractive to me. It was also a very white
            space, so it wasn’t my music. It was the beginning for my longing
            for a different kind of space. So I investigated some of the social
            clubs, like
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://www.facebook.com/The8ballclub/"
              target="_blank"
              >The Eightball Club.</a
            >There is a strong tradition to African American communities of
            having sets. A set is a private party, it might be at somebody’s
            home, or it might be at a hall that was rented. You bought a
            ticket—and for working class people those tickets were pricy—you got
            dressed to the nines, and for the price of the ticket, there was
            dancing, a buffet, and a setup with ice and mixers. You had to bring
            your own alcohol. Those sets and house parties were how I began to
            meet other Black lesbians. They were still strongly oriented around
            alcohol, and I was accustomed to moving in sober spaces. But I
            certainly went to those sets, and I was a young person then. This is
            probably 1978 or so, which means I was a teenager. I was not old
            enough to be in those places. There were older adult women, women in
            their 40’s and 50’s who would scope me out, as they said a baby, and
            they would tell people,
            <i
              >No, you can’t dance with her. She can only have a ginger ale. No
              honey, you don’t sit at that table, you sit over here.</i
            >
            So my experience of entering the Black lesbian community was as a
            place where I was taken care of. Where people looked out for my best
            interest, and where folks might be doing behaviors that were not
            very healthy, but I was always going to be protected by elders in
            that environment. So that is a very important part of my formation
            about what it means to be an adult Black lesbian.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were also house parties in the 1970’s and the 1980’s.
            Cleveland Heights was the place where things were happening, it was
            a place where lesbians could live safely without being harassed by
            their neighbors. And there was a lot of community there, including
            Black community. I remember at least one house party—it was like a
            1930’s Harlem house party. You paid some money at the door because
            you were helping somebody make rent, there was fried chicken coming
            out of the kitchen, and the host literally rolled the rug back to
            the edge of the wall so there was a dance floor. And people were
            <i>delighted</i> to have that space. Those are formative experiences
            for me as a baby dyke that led me to create more of that kind of
            space in Cleveland.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got very involved with the white lesbian community in part because
            they were sober, nonviolent spaces that were oriented toward
            building ongoing daily life, community, and friendship. Everybody
            needs a community in which to feel safe and be recognized, and that
            community was organized around the bookstore. And I’m a very bookish
            person. That community was also organized around a place called The
            Women’s Building Project. This is a very important part of Cleveland
            lesbian history. That building was important for two reasons; one is
            that it had an office there, and it had a library full of lesbian
            and feminist texts. It was a meeting space with comfortable chairs
            and sofas, so if you were trying to organize a group, you had a safe
            space to meet other than someone’s home. And it was sometimes a
            drop-in space. The library would have volunteer librarians who would
            check out books, but mostly keep the space open so that you can drop
            in someplace that wasn’t a bar one evening after work. And the other
            thing that The Women’s Building Project did that was very important
            was house
            <a

            Annual Womyn’s Variety Show—that was THE major social event of the
            year, and kind of the center of lesbian community. People would come
            from Youngstown and Akron and Canton to that event. So that was an
            important geographic space, and an important community, and really
            shaped my ideas of what community could in involve. Community could
            be around learning about something together, or talking about
            something together, as well as partying together. However, that was
            still a mostly pretty white space. It was an occasional Black face I
            would recognize that would show up regularly. But we didn’t have any
            space of our own together.

            <big><i>The Necessary Formation of Sistahparty</i></big>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>MISTINGUETTE:</b>&emsp; One day, I was talking to my friend,
            Denise Jackson, and I said,
            <i
              >"Why can’t we just meet some sistahs that aren’t trying to pick
              us up or are too drunk to remember our names?"</i
            >
            Denise was single at the time, I was not. I was in fact dating
            Denise’s best friend, and I’m now married to her. I said,
            <i
              >"We should throw a party and invite all the Black lesbians we
              know. And it’s gotta be at your house, Denise, because I live in a
              little tiny one-bedroom apartment."</i
            >
            And she said,
            <i>"Yeah, we’ll throw a party. We’ll throw a Sistahparty."</i> And
            that is how Sistahparty was born. We invited some people over, and
            we told them,
            <i>"It’s not potluck, we’ll cook, just bring yourselves."</i> The
            first time there were maybe 8 or 12 people, including Denise’s
            next-door neighbor and a friend who worked at another battered
            women’s shelter. And we enjoyed ourselves so much. We thought, it’s
            so great to have this kind of community where we talk about things
            that matter, let’s do it again. And the next month we did it again,
            and it was twice that size. And we did it again the following month.
            A few Puerto Rican sisters came, and one brought her guitar and one
            brought her drums. And in nine months, there were 150 of us
            gathering on a regular basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of us were completely astonished. We began to break off into
            little cells inside of Sistahparty; the bookish folks had a book
            group, where we’d read a lesbian text together and get together and
            discuss it. There was a group of moms—someone who had been my best
            friend in second grade reconnected with me through Sistahparty and
            started a group for lesbians of Color who were parenting to discuss
            the particular issues that are true there: What does it mean when
            you’re parenting children who are actually your nieces or nephews?
            What does it mean to become a parent through adoption? What does it
            mean when you are co-parenting with your ex-spouse, who is a man,
            who’s not happy that you’re a lesbian? And you don’t have the
            support of your church, and you don’t have the support of your
            family?
          </p>
          <p>
            We realized that we needed to stay in touch with each other, so we
            started a little newsletter. It was a print newsletter, because it
            was the early-1990’s at this point. And people photocopied the
            newsletter at their job when no one was looking [laughs]. We wrote
            out the labels by hand, and we mailed them to 150-200 members. It
            became a really robust institution, and it started to have its own
            annual events. The white lesbian community thought,
            <i
              >Huh, look at that thing that’s happening there. What are we doing
              that makes Women of Color feel like they need a space separate
              from our community? Who are we, and how are we showing up?</i
            >
            So it became an intervention around racism for white lesbians to see
            that this community existed, was self-sustaining, and not asking
            white lesbians for any kind of charitable contribution.

            <br />
            The community continued to grow. At some point we asked for support
            for a conference, a gathering. The artist, Judy Chicago, exhibited
            her piece, The Dinner Party, in Cleveland in 1981, and all the money
            that was earned from the show became the seed money for the Women’s
            Building Project and
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://case.edu/ech/articles/w/womens-community-foundation"
              target="_blank"
              >The Women's Community Fund</a
            >. So Sistahparty asks for money from the Women’s Community Fund. We
            get a grant, and Dagmar Celeste, the governor’s wife, lends us her
            summer home and it was the first convening in a non-social setting
            of Black lesbians, to my knowledge, anywhere in between the west
            coast and the east coast. This is the first intentional lesbian of
            color community and the first gathering of that kind… This is
            probably around 1993.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of consolidating energy came out of that, and one of the
            pieces of energy that came out was those lesbians of color saying,
            <i
              >Wait… there are all these lesbian institutions here? Why are we
              marginalized from them?</i
            >
            So Sistahparty went to the
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://lgbtcleveland.org/"
              target="_blank"
              >The LGBT Community Center</a
            >
            and asked if they would be our fiscal sponsors if we wanted to try
            to get another grant from The Women’s Community Fund, or if we
            wanted to try to raise some money on our own. At the time, the LGBT
            Community Center was mostly white and had, I believe, only one Black
            board member—Frank Lowery—who remembers when the proposal was
            discussed, having his peers on the board say,
            <i>we don’t know these people.</i> In fact, all the members of the
            board had engaged with me and other members of Sistahparty in other
            capacities, but did not think of us as part of a body of People of
            Color. We were individual tokens. So that happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also engaged with the white lesbian community around an event,
            which was a Black and White Ball. We all had a longing for that old
            set party culture where you got dressed up and things were very
            celebratory. It was an elevated occasion because the ethic for
            lesbian community in the 70’s-90’s was
            <i> Come as you are, wear your flannel shirt.</i> People were
            actively resisting the dress of gender and the dress of class. But
            white people were having that problem… Black people weren’t having
            that problem [laughs]. The tradition of the Black and White Ball is
            a tradition that is heightened in Black gay and lesbian communities.
            There are Cotton Balls in the summer, where you wear all white in
            your finest apparel. And in the winter, there are Black and White
            Balls, or Black Velvet Balls, where you are required to wear black
            and white formal wear. I was sent as the ambassador to tell the
            white lesbians that this did not mean they could iron some black
            jeans, and to explain that I was wearing a black velvet column
            dress.

          <p>
            Our Black and White Ball was held at SPACES, which Sistahparty
            rented out for the occasion. And it was difficult! There was not a
            bouncer at the door, there was not an open bar, and some Black and
            Latinx lesbians were like,
            <i>What is this thing? This isn’t a party!</i> There was champagne
            served at midnight, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic for a toast,
            but it wasn’t the center of who we were. The center of who we were
            was dancing and celebrating and seeing our friends and having some
            of our friends see us in a new context.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was the same year that a phalanx of women from Sistahparty
            decided that they wanted to be part of the production staff of Oven
            Production’s Variety Show. Because if they were part of the
            production staff, the skits that got done would include skits with
            Women of Color, there would be Women of Color-led skits. The music
            that got played for dancing would include <i>our</i> music. The
            first time that was really visible, I believe, was at the annual
            Halloween party—that was the other big Oven Productions event. For
            the first time, there were more than six Brown faces in that sea of
            a thousand people. I remember my friend Denise showed up as a white
            girl. She did white face and wore a blond wig [Mistinguette and
            Leila laugh]. So that was a really big deal, because for the first
            time these women were learning skills, learning technical skills.
            They were being seen as leaders in the community, and they were
            making space to enter on their own terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the events that Sistahparty did every year, was we would host
            a community Kwanza, one of the nights of Kwanza, at the LGBT
            Community Center. And that was the only event that we did that was
            not just for Women of Color but for all people of African descent.
            It was a really moving thing. It was usually very small, but people
            brought their parents and their children to that event. I have a
            lovely picture of Frank Lowery in a suit with a Kente Stole holding
            somebody’s baby over his shoulder. And that was really the spirit of
            that event.
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s one other thing that Sistahparty did, which was go public.
            Unlike The Eightball and the other set clubs—nobody ever talked
            about those public as being lesbian clubs. Sistahparty carried a
            twelve-foot long purple and black banner in the Pride parade. It was
            very hard to find four people willing to hold that, because it was
            not safe for people to be out. But we did that, and because we were
            visible, other people felt like they, too, could be visible. The
            Pride parade used to gather in front of CSU and walk down to Public
            Square, right through Downtown Cleveland. It was a very public event
            at a time when many people were closeted. It was certainly a time
            when you could have gotten fired from your job, you would have lost
            custody from your children, you would have gotten thrown out of
            church.

            This is also happening in the early to mid-1990’s when Focus on the
            Family was focused on the Black church. Focus on the Family is a
            national organization of Evangelical religious folk, and they
            created a strategy that, in my opinion, was about removing the
            political power of the Black church. And the way they went about
            that was by providing funding for Black churches to build things
            they needed, like a health center or housing for elders—this is a
            thing that happened across the country so it was different in
            different communities—and what they wanted in exchange for that
            included Black churches to preach against homosexuality. That was a
            brand new thing. The Black church preached against homosexuality and
            against adultery and against stealing, but they weren’t gonna put
            you out if you didn’t do any of those things. The impact was to
            damage Black families as well as Black congregations. During this
            time I was working in AIDS services. I worked for what was then
            called

              >The Health Issues Taskforce</a

            difficulty doing was finding ministers who were willing to say a
            service for Black sons and daughters who had died with AIDS. And
            part of my job was taking the buddy program into Black churches, so
            we could take care of our own, because Black people were not willing
            to come into a white institution to figure out how to take care of
            our own community.

            That was the time in my life, through the community Kwanza and my
            work at the AIDS taskforce, that I started to connect with Black gay
            men, and some of those men sort of picked up the banner when
            Sistahparty fell. Members of Sistahparty and some guys created
            BlackOut Productions, which created social events for Black and
            other People of Color—we were just lesbian and gay then, we didn’t
            have all the letters [laughs]—for the Black lesbian and gay
            community. They followed the Sistahparty tradition, sometimes it was
            a boat ride, sometimes it was a picnic at Edgewater. In fact, there
            was an annual picnic at Edgewater park.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;And to meet in Edgewater Park… that’s visibility.
            That’s rightfully claiming access to public space.

          <br />
          <p>
            <b>MISTINGUETTE:</b>&emsp;And at the time, in the early 1990’s, that
            part of the west side was still almost entirely white. So to see a
            group of Black people at Edgewater Park, period, was an occupation
            of space that was significant. And to recognize that that was a
            lesbian and gay group, and what folks were doing with each other was
            something other than cruising and drinking, was really remarkable.
            So BlackOut Productions happened, and then another Black lesbian
            club called the Punani Posse arose. I was not a part of that, and I
            don’t know much about them, but I do know people who were involved.

          <p>
            And then a sad thing happened… and this speaks to the relationship
            between an informal group like Sistahparty and an institutional
            group like the Lesbian-Gay Community Center [now called the LGBT
            Center of Greater Cleveland]. The Lesbian-Gay Community Center was
            asked by someone at Western Reserve Historical Society to put
            together an archive of the history of our community. And someone
            from the Lesbian-Gay Community Center asked me for archival material
            from Sistahparty, which at the time lived in my bedroom. I put
            together every newsletter we’d ever published, a copy of every flyer
            for every event we had ever done, a sample of minutes from some of
            our meetings, and our photography archive from everyone who had
            given me permission to collect their photographs. We really put a
            lot of work into it, and a year later when I asked,
            <i
              >Hey, what happened with the archival project? How do I get access
              to that at Western Reserve Historical Society?</i
            >
            I was told that our materials had been lost.
          </p>
          <p>[Mistinguette takes a long pause]</p>
          <p>
            And so the only other evidence that Sistahparty ever existed is a
            one-line mention in
            <a

              >Her Neighbor's Wife.</a
            >

            One of the essays mentions the existence of Sistahparty as the only
            group of its kind between San Francisco and New York City. We didn’t
            know we had done a thing like that. We were just trying to raise
            what we needed. And we were trying to pass on that piece of Black
            lesbian culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;There are no words for how deeply you were failed
            by that loss.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>MISTINGUETTE:</b>&emsp;It was not me who was failed or wronged. I
            am aware of young women, including young women in my family, who
            cannot imagine being out. Who cannot imagine a space for Black
            lesbians that’s not about hooking up or drinking. Who cannot imagine
            a community of that like a Kwanza, where they would be centered. And
            who are terrified to go to a Pride parade and could never imagine
            that their aunties before them carried a twelve foot banner that
            said “Sistahparty.” They are the ones who were so badly served by
            that loss.

          <p>
            Folks still talk about it with fondness, and yet didn’t recreate it.
            But it still turns up in little moments. My favorite of which is
            that the Lesbian-Gay Community Center that once told me,
            <i>we don’t know who those people are,</i> is now run by one of
            those people.

            already had institutions that were built for them. They were heavily
            represented in the LGBT bar scene. And for that reason, Queer Women
            of Color tended to create gathering space within their homes. And
            that to me reaffirms that QWOC community often functions as chosen
            family, hospitable and nurturing in ways that biological family may
            not be. So I think there’s something powerful to that domestic
            meeting space.

          <br />
          <p>
            <b>MISTINGUETTE:</b>&emsp; I think there is something powerful to
            the domestic space, and the domestic meeting space that reemerges in
            times when we are not able to build other collective meeting spaces.
            The domestic space reemerged as the Black lesbians, who used to run
            the social clubs and the set parties, aged out of being willing and
            able to hold those kind of public spaces. So people opened their
            homes, and that was a different kind of relationship. And then
            people were able to take up public space, and to do that in a
            networked way rather than a concentrated and exclusive way, like a
            set club.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now people have again had to make community in a home space. Not
            having a physical space where we can point to and say,
            <i
              >We were there, we built that, this thing used to happen there,</i
            >
            prevents a certain kind of recording of history. Toni Morrison
            invented the word “rememory,” and she describes rememory as not
            remembering a thing that was there, but it is actually the physical
            presence of an object or a place that may no longer exist in current
            time, but still manifests and still exists in that historical time
            that we may remember. It presumes that time is not linear, and
            things do not come and go—we come and go. There is rememory of
            Sistahparty, because there is no place we can point to and say
            <i>we built that, we lived here, we tended this spot.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            And I think about that a lot, because when I worked at the battered
            women’s shelter, there was a vacant lot that was next door to us.
            And a group of lesbians led by a Black woman came to that lot,
            cleaned it out, and planted a garden with fruit trees. And I said,
            <i
              >The women who are here in this shelter, they are under a lot of
              distress and they don’t want to do the extra work of tending a
              garden.</i
            >
            And they responded,
            <i
              >that’s okay, because we will always be able to look at that pear
              tree and say we were here. We cared for this space that cared for
              women.</i

            I didn’t know any of those things when I started it. I went on a
            trip with some people and we were listening to Black people in
            Alabama talk about their land, and how they used vocabulary that
            none of us on the trip used. It was significant because those of us
            on the trip were a Black professor of natural history, a Black woman
            who worked in environmental philanthropy. We were the people who
            form other people’s thinking, and we aren’t even using our own
            language to talk about this. One of those people was a Black farmer;
            Leah Penniman of

            is now a national figure. But we were all just on this trip trying
            to figure ourselves out. And I said, you know what, I bet somebody’s
            doing some research about that. So I started asking who was doing
            that work, and people said
            <i
              >I don’t know who’s doing that work, but let me tell you this
              story.</i
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            I started to gather the stories, and I started to do the analysis,
            and one of the people I interviewed in Flint, Michigan said,
            <i
              >Now, don’t waste my time, you take my story and you stand it up
              next to somebody else’s story, and somebody else’s story, and you
              bring me back something I don’t already know.</i
            >
            And that is how I learned that the Black/Land Project is a
            narrative-based research project done by and for Black people. I
            focused it on the post-industrial Midwest, and the places that
            people came from in the South to the post-industrial Midwest. I have
            a cluster of D.C. area interviews, and then Macon County, Alabama
            sent a huge number of people to the Cleveland area—including, as it
            turns out, my own ancestors. I was able to identify my family beyond
            the [?] of slavery as a result of doing the Black/Land work;
            connecting Macon County, Alabama to Cleveland, Ohio

            So I would go to each community, I would do a series of interviews,
            I would make a really low-tech presentation, like PowerPoint instead
            of video so I could really quickly go back to people and say,
            <i
              >Here’s what you told me what your story was—what did I get right?
              What did I get wrong? And how would it be useful for you to get
              this back?</i

            Cleveland wanted it back in the form of

            where folks did some desire mapping about what they would like their
            community land to be used like. The workshop that was led by Place
            Matters, and what started as a one-evening presentation grew to be

            Folks in Flint, Michigan said,
            <i
              >People come and they study us all the time. They read their white
              papers in Washington, but we never get to hear what sense they’ve
              made about what we’ve told them. Could we have one For Us By
              Us?</i
            >
            So Black/Land Project wrote what we called a Brown Paper for Flint.
            The residents of Flint used it to do three things – one was change
            how museum exhibits about the history of Flint, Michigan were
            curated. A second was to serve as a platform that caused the Mayor
            of the City of Flint to invite Black Flintonians to the annual city
            planning process. He put up thirty chairs and a hundred thirty
            people came. So it created this groundswell of desire. And thirdly,
            it provided the first conversations that lead to organizing around
            the water crisis in Flint. So in each city, we had a different
            project around returning that data, but now I need to pull all of
            that together and tell the broader story about what it means that
            Black people have a relationship to land that is not grounded in
            ownership, and is not grounded in territory in the way that
            Indigenous people’s land is, and yet it is still an ethic of care
            and identity.
