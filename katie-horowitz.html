          ><br /><br />
          <p>
            <b>KATIE:</b>&emsp;When I entered the space, the first thing that
            struck me is the way in which the layout of Bounce and Union Station
            respectively were such perfect envelopes for the gay and lesbian
            cultures that they encompassed. What I mean by that is that Bounce
            is this quite large building, and it was divided in two. You’d enter
            into Union Station, which kind of felt like a train car—it was a
            long, deep, but narrower space. At the front of the room were a
            whole bunch of pool tables, and then to right was the bar, and then
            on the left walls there were some booths and tables toward the back.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the way at the back of the space, there was the stage,
            which was really just a makeshift rectangular platform, and then to
            the left of the stage there was a small dressing room. That’s where
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://www.instagram.com/cle_kings_and_girls/?hl=en"
              target="_blank"
              >The Cleveland Kings and Girls</a
            > would perform on Wednesdays. And they
            were/are a troupe of drag kings, but at the time, we were calling
            bio femmes. And that’s a genre of performance that goes by many names
            (some call it bio queen, some say faux queens), but generally bio
            femmes are performers who were assigned female at birth and
            performed as women. Whereas drag kings are generally, again, folks
            who are assigned female at birth and perform as men. Some drag kings
            identify as cis women, some identify as trans masculine, trans men,
            or nonbinary.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the reason that the shape of the space struck me so much is that
            this sort of train car aesthetic, and the under-producedness of it,
            really resonated with me as being evocative of lesbian culture. And
            it was called Union Station, it seemed to be intentionally evoking a
            train station aesthetic. And to me there’s something about what you
            might call lesbian and trans masculine culture that very much
            embraces working class aesthetics, that has an aesthetic of
            imperfection and of grittiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could go back and forth between the two, it was all one
            building. But Bounce was on the other side of the wall from
            Union Station, and that’s where the drag queens performed. And it
            had a much more clubby aesthetic. It had a round stage with a
            catwalk, and it had two levels, so there was a balcony-like level
            that surrounded it that you could go up a ramp to get to. And there
            was a bar on the corner of that room, and then the DJ booth. And
            there were lots of lights, and those shows felt very produced, and in
            fact, after the Saturday night drag shows, there would always be a
            dance party with house music playing. And that to me felt much more
            evocative of gay male culture and trans feminine culture. Even the
            name Bounce evokes youthfulness and fun. All of the lights and the
            nightclub aesthetic of the space, to me, really sits with some of
            our stereotypical ideas about what’s embraced in gay male culture.
            In the book I go on to challenge some of these
            stereotypes. But I do think that it’s significant that the two
            spaces of Bounce and Union Station were so different in layout, in
            appearance, and in the type of crowd that they drew. Because truly,
            gay men and trans women tended to congregate in Bounce whereas
            lesbians and trans men tended to congregate in Union Station for the
            most part. So I guess that’s my starting point about the spaces that
            we spent so much time in, and that drag was taking place in, in the
            early 2000s through the mid-2010s.

            painting a picture of the spatial layout and occupancy. You said it
            was active till the 2010s. How do you find the community, those who
            frequented Bounce/Union Station, to be impacted after the bar’s

            <b>KATIE:</b>&emsp;I don’t think I can overstate how devastating
            that loss felt to a lot of us. I promise I’ll get to your question.
            But I think one of the important things to know about Bounce/Union
            Station is that in its heyday, it was an 18+ club. So there were a
            lot of kids who went there, and this was their first experience
            being accepted into the queer community. It really felt like home to
            a lot of people, it felt like the place where even if they weren’t
            accepted by their biological families, or they were ostracized in
            school, this was a place where they can go and be with their people,
            and be accepted. And there were a lot of really outrageous
            characters who frequented Bounce. One of the performers who I
            worked with—in an interview that I did with her after Bounce had
            closed—she was talking about how it really felt like a place where
            you could experiment. Because no matter how avant-garde you wanted
            to be, no matter how over-the-top you wanted to style yourself,
            there was always going to be someone there who was even further
            out-there. So in that way, it felt really safe for a lot of young
            queer people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Toward the end of its existence, it became a 21+ space, I think that
            was a real loss for a lot of people. We don’t have, or at least to
            my knowledge, we don’t have an LGBT youth center. We do of course
            have the
			            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://lgbtcleveland.org/"
              target="_blank"
              >LGBT Center</a
            > in Cleveland, but I think that a lot of kids
            just felt like this was the place they could go to have fun, and
            they weren’t getting that anywhere else in their life. When Bounce
            changed their policy, it was really hard for a lot of the 18-20-year
            old crowd.
          </p>
          <p>To get back to the question of where people have gone since then; I
          think that the disappearance of Bounce is part of a larger nation-wide
          trend of disappearing gay and lesbian bars. I think we may seem to see
          that partly as a good thing... that queer folks are more widely accepted,
          so that we maybe have less of a need for those kinds of safe spaces.
          For a lot of us, we feel safer going into straight bars and mainstream
          bars. I think that’s probably more true for white queer folks and for
          cisgender queer folks than it is for trans and nonbinary queer folks,
          and queer and trans folks of color.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I think we might also see it as an effect of Capitalism.
            That a lot of gay bars, and particularly in the neighborhood that
            you’re looking at on Detroit and 29th, I think that the
            later-ownership of Bounce decided to prioritize fitting into a
            gentrifying neighborhood over commitments to the queer community
            that was already there. And so we can even see that in the renaming
            of the bar. That block got bought up and renamed ‘Hingetown,’ so
            the owners of Bounce renamed it ‘Bounce Hinge.’ It was clearly
            an effort to try to fit into this new reorientation of that block
            towards young, white, upwardly-mobile millennial families. And it
            clearly pushed out a lot of folks who spent time in that block
            previously who could no longer afford to live there and whose
            gathering spaces were eliminated in favor of juice bars and bike
            shops.
          </p>
          <p>
            The folks that I know who used to frequent Bounce/Union Station have
            told me that they pretty much go to straight bars now when they want
            to go out. I know that Twist in Lakewood has taken over some
            of the functions of Bounce, at least for a while. Twist was never an
            explicitly gay bar, but it was an accepting and welcoming space so a
            lot of folks felt like they could go there and be comfortable. I
            believe that Twist at one point was sponsoring a gay
            kickball/softball team. So they kind of picked up that function. I
            do know that there has not been a singular drag space that has
            cropped up since the closure of Bounce. Drag happens in various
            locations but Bounce used to be THE place to go if you wanted to see
            drag. And now it’s more like, wherever individual performers can
            find a gig at any given time, is where a show will happen. I know
            the Cleveland Kings and Girls have struggled to find a consistent
            location to perform at since Bounce closed, and that feels like a
            real loss, certainly because drag kings are already
            under-represented. Everyone pretty much has at least heard of a drag
            queen, but even within the LGBT community, folks will say ‘what’s a
            drag king? I’ve never heard of that.’ So you know, they’re being
            further marginalized now because they don’t have a place to go, and
            the audience that they had cultivated over the years of
            predominantly lesbian, queer women, trans masculine folks, don’t
            have a centralized gathering space anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            That building was really perfect for what it was. Even the best
            efforts of the owners to become part of this wave of gentrification
            didn’t really work, because even if there is something there now,
            there was a period of year that the building stood empty. And it had
            been a place that was so vital, and full of life, and full of
            community. The Pride afterparties would take place at Bounce. So
            many people I knew met their first love there and ended up marrying
            or partnering long-term. People met their best friends there, people
            would go there for their birthdays, people would go there just to
            watch Glee or RuPaul’s Drag Race or whatever gay show was on. People
            talk to me about just showing up there when they were depressed
            because they knew that they would run into someone they knew who
            would be able to lift them up and help them out. So it was a place
            where life events, both big and small, happened on a consistent
            basis. And where people who felt really dispossessed in other parts
            of their life felt grounded and loved and accepted. And I don’t
            think that anything has cropped up that replaces that. I think gay
            nightlife has taken on a different flavor by necessity because now
            it’s about finding ways to make space for yourself in more
            mainstream straight-oriented clubs and bars than about creating
            something that is intended for queer people from the outset.

          <p><br/>
            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;Would you mind talking a bit about the importance
            and necessity of these trans-inclusive and Black, Indigenous, and
            POC-centered spaces in the context of this moment? (Amid mass protests in support of BLM)
          </p><br/>
          <p>
            <b>KATIE:</b>&emsp;That’s a really important question. And it’s
            something I think about a lot because in my work right now. I am
            part of <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://charlotteuprising.com/"
              target="_blank"
              >a collective that is doing jail support</a
            > here in Charlotte—we
            basically sit outside the jail and provide services for people who
            are being released, and we have an abolitionist orientation. So this
            is something that’s really important to me. I think that part of a
            prison abolitionist and police abolitionist framework requires
            creating the world in which we see ourselves safe. And we don’t need
            prisons and police to keep us safe, because they already don’t. They
            keep a very select demographic of property-owning white folks safe,
            and even that’s not reliable. They don’t do much of anything to
            protect anyone who is not wealthy and white. And so part of that
            vision of the world in which we keep ourselves safe is about
            building community and building relationships of trust in which you
            know the people around you well enough, and care about them enough
            that if someone causes you harm, you’re not going to call the
            police. You’re going to call upon other folks in the community to
            facilitate holding each other accountable and repairing the harm
            that was done, so to rebuild trust within the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to do that, you need spaces to go. One thing that makes
            this work especially hard to do is that a lot of folks who are
            invested in abolition don’t own property, or they’re houseless, or
            they don’t have stable housing, they don’t have food security.
            Building communities when you don’t have a physical space to go is a
            really difficult proposition and an uphill battle. And having places
            like the kind of place that Bounce/Union Station used to be is vital
            to being able to do that work. One of the beautiful things to me
            about Bounce was that we had such a diverse population of folks
            there. It was racially diverse, it was diverse in terms of gender,
            there were older folks who were there, there were 18 year olds who
            were there, there were folks with physical and intellectual
            disabilities who came there. Because we all have this love of that
            place, Bounce, we kept coming and we got to know each other and we
            got to connect with people who we probably wouldn’t have met
            otherwise. I don’t think that Bounce was any kind of a utopia, but I
            think there was potential there that does not exist within a more
            homogenous and homogenizing place like Hingetown. So in order to
            protect the most marginalized among us, there needs to be
            opportunities for those most marginalized folks to <i>a)</i> have stability
            and <i>b)</i> to connect with folks who currently have the kind of
            privilege to be able to support them with the resources that
            marginalized folks don’t necessarily have. We’re finding fewer and
            fewer spaces to do that in the wake of all of this
            gentrification. So we have to be more intentional about creating
            those spaces if we want to move forward in ways that are centered on
            Black and Indigenous queer and trans folks.
