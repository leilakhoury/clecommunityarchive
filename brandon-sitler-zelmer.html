          <p><b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;What were the sports leagues like?</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>BRANDON:</b>&emsp;The sports leagues were a lot of fun. They had
            softball, they had volleyball, and it turned into—you know, you say
            safe haven and community and a place to be yourself. That’s really
            what these places were like. You would join the softball team
            and everybody instantly becomes your best friend. You’d go to their
            house for Thanksgiving and Christmas and Easter and Fourth of July
            parties. They would do softball tournaments and all the money would
            go towards the gay homeless shelter, gay youth centers, gay hospice…
            they really did a lot for our community as far as outreach went.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grew up in Claridon, Ohio. When I was growing up, I knew I was gay
            from a very young age but I didn’t know anybody else that was gay in
            my area. When I came out of the closet I instantly lost every single
            one of my friends, all my family stopped talking to me because they
            thought—you know that’s when everything happened with Matthew
            Shephard and AIDS was still at a high—so people thought even if they
            shook my hand they were going to catch AIDS. And I had a friend’s
            mom tell my friend that I wasn’t allowed at the house anymore,
            because they were afraid that they’d all catch AIDS if I used their
            bathroom. I moved away, from Claridon to Florida, because I didn’t
            feel safe in the small town that I was at. But even in Florida I
            tended to stay closeted because of my experience in Geauga County. I
            was only out there for about two years before I moved back to
            Cleveland.

            When I moved back to Cleveland, I went on the M4M chatline, like
            “I’m 21 years old, I’m new to Cleveland, I don’t know anybody gay,
            will someone please take me to a bar?” [Laughs] and this guy Josh
            answered the ad. I met him at The Cage, and he was my first friend
            in Cleveland. It was eye-opening, you go to this bar where everyone
            is comfortable with themselves, music is blaring, people are wearing
            whatever they want, just being free and having a good time. I
            remember when you’d go up to The Cage, all the windows were blacked
            out so you couldn’t tell that it was a bar. It was in a nondescript,
            brick, single-story building with a shopping center, and you just
            walked in and it was awesome. It was all black inside with a disco
            ball and laser lights and the music blaring. That’s where I really
            met my first large group of friends, hanging out at The Cage every
            night.

            My first gay bar that I worked at in Cleveland was actually
            Interbelt, then from Interbelt to Twist, Twist to Deco, and then
            Deco to Man’s world. And Man’s World was crazy. Man’s World was
            actually three bars in one… so it was Man’s World, Crossover, and
            Toolshed. When you first walked in, it was Toolshed. And then you’d
            walk through the hallway and that was supposed to be Crossover
            because you’d cross over the hallway, then when you go downstairs
            you’re in Man’s World. At the time Man’s World was really only
            supposed to be for leather men. Even if you were in jeans or a
            button up and tennis shoes you couldn’t be down there. You had to be
            wearing some kind of leather or you had to be shirtless. They
            lightened those rules up later on, but they tried to keep it a
            little bit more private for the leather-type guys down there. And
            then the crossover was supposed to be more like a bear version of a
            sports bar, it had the pool table in there, and then the toolshed
            was kinda more like, I don’t know if it was supposed to be
            country/western theme but they had country line dance nights there,
            things like that. It was a fun place to be, it was definitely a lot
            of crazy nights [laughs] and a lot of insane stuff going on. But
            that was one of my favorite places to work just because everybody
            that went there was so unique, all the clientele that hung out,
            everyone had their own story. I got to meet a lot of cool people
            working at that job.

            about five years in he left his full-time job to help expand it. I
            met Jeff the day I moved to Cleveland. I moved in with my roommate,
            Nick, and he’s like ‘let’s go out and celebrate your move.’ So we go
            to Bounce, it was Halloween night, and I see Jeff and I turn to Nick
            like ‘Oooh that guy’s really cute.’ He introduced me and we’ve been
            together pretty much since [laughs].

          <p>
            <b>BRANDON:</b>&emsp;It’s crazy, I actually moved to Cleveland
            thinking I was only going to live here for a couple months then move
            out. Just try to get my bearings back and figure out what I want to
            do with the next stage of my life. But when I moved here, I went to
            the gay bars every night and made such a cool group of friends and
            such a tight community that I didn’t want to leave. I think when you
            don’t have a community around you it’s easy to feel like you’re
            blowing in the wind… You don’t really have a plan or a goal or a
            focus. When I moved here and I met all these people, I was inspired
            by all these people. At that point I’m a 21 year old kid looking to
            get drunk every night, but then I meet these people working for

            >, working for the Center for Family Solutions, working
            for the food bank, working for Pride. And then you want to be a part
            of that. It made me want to set roots, it made me want to join a
            softball team or a volleyball team or work at the LGBT Center and do
            events at Pride. And when I started doing that, I started to think
            further about what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I had no
            floral background, but somebody that I met at a bar worked at a
            flower shop and told me it’s something I’d probably be good at. I
            applied for the job, got the job, and started working as a designer
            at the shop. It wasn’t something I planned but I fell in love with
            that. And none of that would happen if I didn’t move to Cleveland,
            if I didn’t work at the bar, if I didn’t meet the florist, and if I
            didn’t meet Jeff. I wouldn’t be a florist right now. I wouldn’t own
            Urban Orchid. So it really set a course for my life the way it was
            trajected.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we started with Urban Orchid, I had
            the whole community’s support around me as well. When we opened the
            stores, everybody I’ve ever met at a bar or LGBTQ softball
            tournament, they were my customers, they were coming there because
            they knew me and wanted to support me, not necessarily because they
            needed flowers [laughs]. And even now, ten years later, I am
            constantly getting recommendations from people that I haven’t seen
            in like fifteen years. Like ‘my friend Jay knew you from Twist or
            knew you from Man’s World and said I should talk to you.’ That
            constant support from the community in this area is insane, and it’s
            beautiful.

            <b>BRANDON:</b>&emsp;Since we’re more comfortable being out in the
            open, we’re going to every bar now. Gay bars weren’t making the
            money to sustain themselves because there wasn’t necessarily a large
            group going to those bars anymore, because we were going everywhere.
            Those bigger bars like Bounce couldn’t really support themselves. So
            the reason the bars were shutting down was because we felt safer
            going out to every bar. But that is a good thing. It’s a good thing
            that gay people feel comfortable going out in public to whatever
            space that we want, that we feel safe and accepted. There is always
            going to need for a safe space because not everyone’s always gonna
            feel safe. There’s always gonna be need for a gay bar. I don’t
            personally think I could go to straight-only bars at all times. But
            I know I can go out with my friends and not get made fun of, teased,
            beat up, and that wasn’t always the case.

          <p>
            <b>BRANDON:</b>&emsp;And I feel that same way above the generation
            above me, because I was able to come out at 18 when a lot of those
            people didn’t come out until they were like 40 or 50. And before
            that people didn’t come out at all. So every generation is one step
            closer to being the best that it can be. I don’t know if it will
            ever be awesome, but we’re trying.
