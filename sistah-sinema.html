            in Seattle, WA as a space for dialogue and representation of Queer
            Women of Color through film. Sistah Sinema’s monthly film screenings
            (held by chapters across the country and globe) were accompanied by
            panel discussions, guest speakers, and other events to connect and
            create space for QWOC community members, activists, and
            organizations.
            <br /><br />In 2012, Deidre McPherson founded Sistah Sinema,
            Cleveland while working a full-time job in marketing. This work and
            experience coincided with her eventual career change into arts
            programming; first as Curator of Public Programs at MOCA Cleveland,
            and currently as Director of Public Programs at The Cleveland Museum of Art. We begin by
            discussing the early days of Sistah Sinema, planting roots, and
            building community.

          <p>
            <b>DEIDRE:</b>&emsp;Originally, Sistah Sinema was on the first
            Friday of every month, and we did that for the first two years. I
            still had a full-time job and had just migrated back to Cleveland. I
            boomeranged back, I left Cleveland for about 7-10 years and I moved
            back here to work at the Cleveland Orchestra, and I didn’t know
            anybody. All my friends that I grew up were moving and working in
            other cities. I was obsessed with this film, <i>Pariah</i>, and I
            saw someone was doing a screening of it in another city. This film
            was important—this was like the first film coming out that features
            a queer woman of color as the lead character, and it’s about her
            experience. And I thought, I wish there were a space where queer
            women of color could discuss a film after a screening. I thought
            that was so important because I didn’t have that growing up. There
            wasn’t that representation. So for me, seeing that, I felt like I
            needed that in Cleveland.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the time, Phyllis Seven Harris was the board member for
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://lgbtcleveland.org/"
              target="_blank"
              >The LGBT Community Center of Greater Cleveland</a
            >, and I had just met her through a meetup group for Black women
            with natural hair. And I was like ‘I need to be her friend. I don’t
            know any other queer women of color in Cleveland.’ When I got the
            idea to bring Sistah Sinema to Cleveland, Seven was the first person
            I called. And I said ‘Seven, I got this idea, it’s this thing called
            Sistah Sinema, it’s happening in Seattle, I talked to the founder,
            she said I could bring it to Cleveland, I don’t know any queer women
            of color [laughs] how am I going to build an audience for this
            thing?’ Seven opened up her home, she invited the most vocal queer
            women of color and BIPOC, so I could tell
            them about Sistah Sinema and to ask for their support. She was like
            ‘I support you, I see you, and this is important.’ She helped me
            build a market because I didn’t have those connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I was like okay, I’m ready, what do I need to do? I need an
            email list. I need to make a press release... how do I make a press
            release? So I googled that. How do you make a flyer? How do you make
            preview slides, so that when your audience is waiting for the
            program to begin, they can see what’s going on in the community?
            What should the conversation be after the film? What are they key
            ideas? What are the takeaways? How can we relate this to our
            experience? Are there panelists? Are there performers? Are there
            speakers? Are there artists that we should hear from that relate to
            the subject matter of this film? The films were being curated and
            selected by the founder, Isis Asare, and I would pay a fee to show
            that film in Cleveland and break even on costs to show it and share
            it locally. Word of mouth grew, and I mean it was a
            multi-generational event. It was queer women of color, queen people
            of color from ages twenty to seventies. There was a woman in her seventies who would
            come, and she was just coming out to herself. Sistah Sinema was the
            first public event that she had ever been to where she was
            surrounded by queer people of color and acknowledging that she was a
            queer woman. She found community in her seventies in the same way I had
            just migrated back to Cleveland in adulthood and didn’t know anyone,
            but Seven helped lift me up and we created in this space.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s how it grew. It was monthly for several years and then we
            reduced the frequency. It was very much a startup and we were trying
            to figure out what was successful. Sistah Sinema had chapters in
            Cleveland, Portland, Seattle, for a while we had Kingston, Jamaica,
            Charlotte NC, Oakland, I mean, there were chapters in Texas at one
            point, and I got a chapter started in Columbus because we had a
            panelist in Columbus. It grew organically. It was one thing to go to
            a club or a lounge, but I think there are more clubs geared toward
            gay men and queer men then there are women. I don’t know what it is,
            but there are articles on this. I think women cultivate spaces in
            our homes and different spaces that aren’t necessarily clubs. But
            Sistah Sinema became the other thing to do. We would experiment with
            having an individual facilitate a conversation after a film. One
            time we showed a film that was a romantic comedy and we created a
            dating game with contestants [laugh] so it was like this fun
            experience where we were trying to make love happen because it
            happened to be February. We’d get a film screening on Black lesbians
            of the Harlem Renaissance; there was all types of queerness and
            creativity and artistry happening in Harlem, and no one really talks
            about the queerness… we talk about Langston Hughes, we talk about
            the writers and the visual artists of that time, but we’re not
            talking about how many of those important voices were queer people
            of color. So we did a program on that and that was amazing.

            opening a brand new building in University Circle. I met the
            director through a research project and I was working at the
            Cleveland Orchestra at the time. She was interviewing me about my
            going into visual arts and I ended up talking about Sistah Sinema.
            She reached out to me after I had participated in this research
            project and she was like ‘Hey, I’d love for you to come do a Sistah
            Sinema program when we open our new building in University Circle.’
            And I was like really? Okay, I guess I see it, you’re a contemporary
            art museum, you’re interested in diversifying your audience, so you
            want to welcome us and create space for queer POC, and you’re
            looking at film as art. At the time I was doing Sistah Sinema
            programs in art galleries… I was doing it at SPACES, I was doing it
            at Negative Space Gallery, I was doing it at Waterloo Arts, doing it

          <p>
            The film that we had at MOCA was Tiona McClodden's
            <i>Bumming Cigarettes.</i>
            It was a short film about a Black lesbian who has a conversation
            with a homeless man who was bumming a cigarette from her while she
            awaits her AIDS test results. Usually the AIDS conversation in films
            are focused on white men, this one was about a Black lesbian, and it
            was a film by a Black lesbian. I reached out to Case Western Reserve
            University’s LGBT Center and LGBT Center of Greater Cleveland and
            brought them in as sponsors. They helped pay for bringing the
            filmmaker, now-turned artist Tiona McClodden to Cleveland for the
            film screening at MOCA. So that took the programming up a notch.
            Here we are at this brand new contemporary art space, we brought the
            filmmaker from Philadelphia to Cleveland, and the filmmaker is in
            dialogue with the executive director of the
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="http://clevelandtaskforce.org/"
              target="_blank"
              >AIDS Taskforce of Greater Cleveland</a
            >. We tried to get everybody to the table so we could have a full
            house, so we could have an audience to have a conversation around
            this film, around AIDS, and we’re connecting this film with the
            mission of our city’s AIDS taskforce in a contemporary art museum.
            And Tiona McClodden today is a very important contemporary artist
            and emerging voice. So Tiona’s debut in Cleveland was a Sistah
            Sinema film, not an art installation, and that was such an honor.

            <br /><br />So after I got laid off [from the aforementioned
            marketing job], MOCA was like, 'oh yeah we think we got a job you
            might be interested in. Have you ever heard of being a curator of
            public programs?' That’s how I got into that, and I fell in love
            with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was loving the idea of creating a space for underrepresented
            audiences and voices who don’t have a seat at the table and are not
            considered a priority. To be part of making that cultural shift in
            what’s being presented and talked about. To ask; what are the voices
            leading the conversation? How are we connecting all these parts of
            our cultural ecosystem together in something that’s valuable, that
            people talk about, and they tell their friends about? I wanted this
            unique space where I was not the only queer person of color, where
            the conversation was one in which I could be my full self. That was
            something that I needed, that I craved, and that was universal for
            other queer women of color and queer people of color. There were
            definitely queer men and gender nonconforming people who came too.

            <b>DEIDRE:</b>&emsp;Other programs that were really important to me were ones where the
            film was about our trans brothers and sisters. For me, that was an
            education. When I came out at 28, I knew about my experience as a
            Black lesbian, but I didn’t know about the experience of trans
            people. And so having an opportunity to show a number of films that
            looked at the experiences of trans women and trans men—and we’d do
            it in conversation with leaders of trans activism in Cleveland,
            where they are leading a conversation so that we can stand in
            solidarity with them, so they can share resources with us, so that
            we can be true allies and raise visibility for the issues that we
            know are still prevalent—for me, that was growth. And for audiences,
            that was important.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had a wide representation of films that we were showing that
            helped keep Sistah Sinema going. The logo of Sistah Sinema was of a
            Black woman with an afro, but it really was about all queer BIPOC.
            The genre of films was also diverse. Whether it was a romantic
            comedy or a documentary (which were my favorite.) We had stories
            about the Latinx community, Southeast Asian and Indian voices,
            Indigenous people, there were Native American Queer Women Shorts.
            [Deidre takes a moment to read through the spreadsheet of SS films]
            … We had a zombie-love-story-musical, okay! [laughs]. The way the
            films were curated, it was important that we represent all queer
            women of color.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were really a range of experiences in Sistah Sinema too and
            that was so beautiful. There were women and queer people who had
            been aware of their identity and their orientation throughout their
            whole life, and then there were those who were late bloomers like
            me, I didn’t really come out to myself till I was 28, and then there
            was this one woman who was in her seventies. That brought me so much
            joy that she found this space. I don’t know how she found it, but
            she found it through the LGBT Center of Greater Cleveland. The
            Center was really instrumental in helping us reach new audiences. So
            somehow the word got out to this woman and she would come to these
            events, she didn’t have a car but people would pick her up and bring
            her. And there would be popup tables—there were people who would
            come to Sistah Sinema who would be like ‘hey could I have a table to
            sell my jewelry, to sell my new book?’ So there were queer women of
            color who were lifting me up so that I could create this platform,
            and I’m using this platform to lift other people up. That was a
            lesson for me too. Like yeah absolutely, come bring your art, share
            it with us, tell people about your work. Let’s support one another.

            <b>DEIDRE:</b>&emsp;One thing that came out of the screening at MOCA was that somebody
            had invited an LGBT community leader from Pittsburgh and another
            LGBT leader from Columbus, and that led to connections to queer
            women of color communities in those cities. So that’s how the
            Columbus chapter of Sistah Sinema got started. We organized a queer
            women of color picnic, where we had a caravan of folks from
            Cleveland that drove to Columbus to have fellowship and food with
            queer women of color in Columbus. There were probably about thirty
            or so folks all gathering together, and we tried to make that an
            annual thing.

            We made bumper stickers, we made buttons [laughs] we had a table at
            Pride. Every year for the Cleveland International Film Festival, the
            festival would have community partners that would essentially
            promote a film that connects to that nonprofit’s mission. So anytime
            the festival had a film in their schedule lineup about a queer woman
            of color, I would be the community partner on that film, Sistah
            Sinema Cleveland. And I would get to introduce that film at the
            screening and introduce people to Sistah Sinema. And then I had a
            table outside the film so I can meet people, get them on my email
            list and invite them to the next Sistah Sinema program. We were
            really grassroots… there was no marketing budget, I mean I made a
            little bit of money from programs, but tried to reinvest it in
            growing. For me it was a passion project, and with each film
            screening we were reaching a different community, whether it’s the
            Latinx community or other different ethnic and cultural groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            We started having food, food fellowship, people would be selling
            plates, so it became more than a movie. Like yeah, you’re coming to
            see a movie, but these are films that are not widely-distributed,
            you’re not gonna see these films at Regal Cinema. There was no
            Netflix, there was no Hulu. We didn’t have these independent
            channels where these independent films were being distributed the
            way they are today. So Sistah Sinema was IT! And the woman who
            started it, she was so entrepreneurial, she was thinking about how
            to make a whole channel of media. She had big aspirations and she
            was very forward-thinking. Of course I think the model for now,
            especially in a virtual world, would be very different.

            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;Hearing more about Sistah Sinema as you go into
            detail, it’s just clearly such an important and necessary resource,
            and on so many levels. The representation of QWOC in film is
            extremely important in and of itself, and on top of that you’re
            creating this really diverse programing, room for discussion, and
            also the safe space—I keep thinking about this elderly woman who
            found her community there.

          <p>
            <b>DEIDRE:</b>&emsp;Yeah! When I first moved back to Cleveland I was
            not “out”. My parents go to a pretty conservative Black Baptist
            church and there’s an expectation that I go each week. And I’m like
            trying to find my legs in my city, like, I’m about to start this
            REALLY gay project [laughs]. I come out to my parents slightly
            before that because I was like, ok if I get into a relationship and
            I fall in love I’m going to come out to my parents. And that
            happened. And then I go to church with them and one of their friends
            goes “Heeeyyyy! You’re a star! I saw your film club in the
            newspaper, that’s great! Congratulations!” And my mom’s like... not
            sure how to feel about it. [laughs] My parents are amazing, they’re
            in their late seventies, they see how this work has given me life
            and lead to me doing what I do now at the museum, which you know,
            they’re really proud of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            My intent was not to be in leadership… I’m an organizer, I’m an
            activist type, that just happens when you organize things. And that
            was an interesting journey too. It was helpful for me to look back
            at other people who were organizing and doing comparable work in
            creating spaces for queer women of color. I thought about people
            like

              >Sherry Bowman</a
            >
            and other women before me who have created these spaces. I look to
            them with much respect, and I was thinking, how can I work with
            them? How can I learn from them? Seven was definitely a mentor and a
            good friend and people like

            been an artist, was helping me in sharing their voice in Sistah

          </p>
          <p>
            There was so much diversity in the queer people of color who came,
            and no other reason why we would have all met. There were
            relationships, people were hooking up, there were love matches,
            there were friendships, there were vacations taken, people made
            friends, I made friends, I made connections, that kept me coming, I
            think that kept people coming back. There are queer women of color
            working in every sector of our city, in technology, in medicine, in
            academia, in the arts, but we would’ve never crossed paths if there
            wasn’t this thing we were all going to and sharing our voices where
            we could connect with each other. I can go to church and get my
            healing, but I can’t be my full self. I can go to work, I work in a
            predominantly white institution—I love arts and culture, that’s what
            I have in common with these people—but I still can’t be my full
            self. They don’t really understand my queerness, my Blackness.
            Sistah Sinema was unique in that it filled that space, it was that
            third space where I’m seen and I can really talk about all these
            complexities, these challenges, these opportunities, these beautiful
            things about our identities as queer women of color.

            I do miss it. When I started organizing these events, that was not
            my 9-5, it was a passion project, but then my career transitioned
            and it became my career, organizing these events and programs. I did
            fewer and fewer Sistah Sinema events, but every once in a while I
            would be invited or asked to do something special. When Waterloo
            Arts decided to organize the first exhibition of trans artists in
            the state, they reached out like ‘Hey Deidre, would you be able to
            recommend any films we could show in support of this exhibition of
            trans artists?’ I had just had the opportunity to be a judge for
            short films for CIFF—me and two other people watched every single
            short film in the festival and we picked the winners. So I had just
            seen like five films out of a couple hundred that were about trans
            people. So I connected Waterloo Arts with CIFF and I said hi, this
            exhibition’s important, can we show some of these films in
            connection with the exhibition?
          </p>
          <p>
            Something else that I was really proud of was—are you familiar with
            Zanele Muholi?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;Ooh yes.</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>DEIDRE:</b>&emsp;Right? We showed Zanele Muholi’s
            <i>Difficult Love</i> in all Sistah Sinema chapters. So while I’m
            working at MOCA, Zanele Muholi was chosen as the endowed lecturer in
            contemporary art at CMA. And they were like, how can we get queer
            women of color to this event to see this endowed lecture? [laughs]
            We don’t know any. And someone was like ‘Wait, do you know Deidre
            McPherson? She works at MOCA, why don’t you reach out and ask her if
            she can help us bring that audience to Zanele Muholi’s lecture.’ So,
            I’m working at MOCA and I’m like well, have you seen her film
            <i>Difficult Love</i>? I suggested having a Sistah Sinema program at
            MOCA with Zanele Muholi on Friday night, and then encourage the
            audience to go hear her endowed lecture the next day at CMA. And
            they were like, Okay! [laughs] and people were like oh my god, I
            have an opportunity to meet Zanele Muholi from South Africa. You
            know, this photographer is internationally renowned.

          <p>
            So that was my introduction to CMA. And I think Zanele really
            appreciated that we had made that effort, that we had had an
            audience of what felt like family—It’s not just the typical white
            museum audience, there are actually queer women of color, BIPOC here
            because someone had the insight to reach out to Sistah Sinema. But
            those things don’t always happen. Predominantly white-led
            institutions don’t always know how to, or they fail to develop the
            audiences that come to these spaces. That was kinda how and why
            Sistah Sinema found a home in SPACES, and that I ended up on their
            board. I wanted to serve SPACES and be on their board because that’s
            where I had held the events most of the time. And it was benefitting
            them as well, because here I was bringing Sistah Sinema audiences to
            a contemporary arts space. This audience is not usually like ‘hey
            let’s go see contemporary art at SPACES,’ but even though we’re
            hosting Sistah Sinema events there was kinda like oh, maybe there’s
            some relevance or connection to actually coming back to the space.
            So that was I think why SPACES and MOCA found it beneficial. They
            wanted to connect with diverse audience and that’s how they
            recognized Sistah Sinema could do that.

          <p>
            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;You would know much more about this than me, but
            it seems like art institutions are finally being held accountable, in a way that’s more
            urgent, to reckon with their own systemic racism.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>DEIDRE:</b>&emsp;Oh yeah. Everybody made the default social media
            posts standing in solidarity with the Black community. Whether it’s
            corporate or predominantly white institutions, we’ve seen all the
            statements. Now it’s like, what are you gonna do about it? The City
            of Cleveland, City of Akron, and City of Columbus have all declared
            racism a public health crisis. Three cities in Ohio. And there are
            institutions signing pledges that they commit to doing programming
            to help address fighting institutional and systemic racism, fighting
            this public health crisis. Not everybody’s ready to sign that pledge
            though, because a lot of institutions need to look at themselves and
            actually understand what it means to stand in solidarity. It doesn’t
            mean ‘Black people, we’re prayin’ for you.’ It means, ‘We’re going
            to take a look at ourselves and commit to doing better. We’re not
            going to be perfect, we’re going to make some mistakes, but we’re
            going to do the work and we’re going to look at our whiteness and
            how we have historically not created a welcoming space for anyone
            who wasn’t white. How we were not founded for everybody. But we now
            recognize that we need to be for everybody if we want to sustain
            ourselves.’ And that’s the right thing to do. Oh yeah, morals,
            values, that too, yeah [laughs].
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s been really interesting to look at different institutions,
            whether it’s the NFL or San Francisco MOMA or Cleveland
            Institutions, how there’s often a lack of humility around admitting
            historic missteps, admitting how historically we have not been
            inclusive. Very few are doing that and I think that’s essential in
            building trust. Because of the systems and the structures in place,
            that have been in place since the origins. Because we have
            predominantly white boards, white staff, white everything, and these
            are broken systems that need to be fixed. It’s going to take more
            than one person or one diverse staff member. It’s going to take
            really looking at and dismantling the systems that got us here in
            the first place. There’s a lot of education… I gotta educate myself
            too. Yes, I’m a Black queer woman, but I gotta decolonize myself,
            I’ve been working at predominantly white institutions and I don’t
            want to be elitist or leave anyone to feel left out. I know what it
            feels like to be left out for being different, for being othered. I
            want us arts administrators to continue the work, across our
            cultural, artistic, educational, civic, ecosystem in our city. I
            want us all to continue these conversations, to change policies at
            the organizational level. It’s not one event or one program that’s
            gonna completely fix or change the landscape.
