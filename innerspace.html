              Before opening what would eventually be known as The Innerspace,
              Jake Griswold began hosting film screenings at the Bela Dubby—an
              “almost” DIY spot/coffee shop formerly located in Lakewood. On his
              first night, sometime in January of 2010, he screened a concert
              film which he helped produce for WCSB’s Halloween Ball. The film
              was only 45 minutes long, so he paired it with a punk film called
              Class of 1984. These double-feature movie nights would continue
              monthly until the venue closed in 2012.</b

            <b>JAKE:</b>&emsp;I like the idea of a double feature because
            somebody could just wander in. If you’re going to a movie, the movie
            show time is at 8:15. You gotta be there at 8:15 or else you’re
            stuck out. But with a double feature, people could wander in at any
            time instead of the door being shut. I like more of a communal
            experience.

            …Around the beginning of 2013, friend introduced me to this guy Mark
            who had just purchased this giant Vietnamese Buddhist Temple,
            straight from the group after they moved out. I told him I’d help
            him repair the spot and yeah, we started doing movie nights there.
            I helped him redo the ceilings, we painted all the walls white
            and kinda cleared out that space and set it up so I could project
            right onto the walls. And we did our very first event there May 1st
            2013… May Day. That was the beginning of that. And it wasn’t called
            The Innerspace back then. At the beginning it was called The
            People’s Temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started out showing cult movies, like literal double features
            about cults. After I ran out of cult double-features it would be
            like ‘malfunctioning robot night’ or ‘haunted house night’ or ‘girl
            gang double feature.’ Whatever different weird topics, I could pair
            up movies together that would be kinda fun. And my friend would
            bring a pizza or two to share every week, so we’d have an
            intermission with free pizza. We had a pretty nice setup, we had
            couches set up in there. The screen was very big, just having the
            wall painted white, it made the screen more immersive, having it
            blown up so big. Even VHS blown up that big looks great.

                >The main principles of the place for me was that it was always
                going to be free—we collected donations—but no one was ever
                going to get turned away for lack of money. And everybody was
                welcome, as long as they’re friendly. I thought that would be
                the way of the future. Trying to get rid of money and stuff.</i

            I was very naïve that first year. Advertising was mainly done by
            making flyers, which I would make every week, print out from the
            radio station, and then go and post all over… around Gordon Square,
            Ohio City, Lakewood, I’m a west sider so mainly the west side. And
            the people who came that year were mainly people I knew. You’d look
            around at some of the more well-attended ones and it was a lot of
            WCSB DJs. But sometimes people would wander in, you’d hear people at
            the door who aren’t sure whether they’re wandering into someone’s
            house, not sure if they’re at the right place.
          </p>
          <p>
            But like I said, I was naïve and would put up fliers at places like
            the Capitol Theatre. And I soon found out that I had pissed them off
            pretty good, like this guy came in and was like ‘are you getting
            permission to show any of these films?’ And I was like, ‘well no,
            this is just a DIY thing, this isn’t an official thing. Everybody
            gets in for free, and I’m not showing Hollywood movies. These are
            independent films.’ They pointed out one movie I’d shown, this
            really crazy Japanese movie from the 70’s, they were like ‘The
            Cinematheque showed that movie a couple years ago, and they’re
            pissed.’
          </p>
          <p>
          So I started to look at everything, the Cinematheque schedules,
            the Capitol schedules, I really tried not to do any crossovers with
            any of the other theaters. They were considering calling the FCC,
            MGM, whoever. So after that I was pretty careful. But otherwise that
            first year went by pretty smoothly, we had a 6-month long run. Then
            I shut it down for the winter and went traveling like I usually do.

              Trotsky’s ____, which played silently with the subtitles on for
              the film’s duration. Jake loved the idea of events that combined
              different artistic disciplines and saw a growing need for more
              immersive live music events in general. In particular, he was
              influenced by the disco scene he DJ’d/attended during his yearly
              trips to Mexico and South America. Him and 3 other WCSB DJs
              started an event called Disco Patrol, which began in the Mahall’s
              basement.</b

            <b>JAKE:</b>&emsp;In the Summer of 2015, we made flyers for our
            first [Disco Patrol] at The People’s Temple, and that’s when we got
            our first visit from the city. This city inspector came and asked us
            about running an illegal movie theater. Said ‘this place is not
            zoned for this, you can’t be having events here, and we’re gonna
            fine you if you don’t stop doing it.’ So that was the first time I
            changed the name from The People’s Temple to just ‘The Temple,’ I
            was trying to be clever so I could advertise more on Facebook. We
            stopped doing movie nights for a while and moved over to 78th Street
            Studios to let it die down.

                Before the city inspector’s visit I had started having guest
                hosts and opening it up to others to do their own screenings. My
                dream was to have the space open to different community members
                and even have people come in from different countries to show
                movies. I just had these dreams—you know, we just did pizza
                because it was practical and there was no kitchen—but you know,
                we’d have hosts and cuisines and films from different countries.
                That was my dream for that space.</i

            But in April 2016 I was more determined than ever to get the dance
            parties going. I changed the name to The Innerspace to throw the
            city off my trail. I had these concepts for the dance parties. For
            the first one (June 2016), I borrowed projectors from a bunch of
            different people, and I instructed everyone (of course not everyone
            did) to wear all-white clothing, and we were gonna project onto them
            from above, so everyone on the dancefloor becomes a kinda moving
            projection… It was still under the Disco Patrol banner that I did
            under Mahall’s. “Disco Patrol Presents: How to Blow Your Mind & Have
            a Freak Out Party.” That was the name of the first one.<br /><br />

            />
          </ul>
          <p>
            The second party was called “Disco Patrol Presents: Future World,”
            and we got all these projections, a lot of VHS tapes, all these
            weird old sci-fi movies, and tried to get the décor all
            futuristic. That one got a bigger audience, like 80 people showed up
            to that, so that was June/July.
          </p>
          <p>
            In August, we did a Zodiac Killer party, where Haley [singer of <a
                class="body-link"
                href="https://pleasureleftists.bandcamp.com/"
                target="_blank"
                                                                               >Pleasure Leftists]</a> made
            buttons of everyone’s zodiac sign—We’re like alright, we’re gonna
            have different sections of the room… earth signs over here, fire
            signs over here, and everybody wears the button of whatever their
            sign is. And we’re doing fire visuals over here, water visuals over
            here etc. We even hired a psychic and had a table set up for palm
            readings. We weren’t always totally successful—but we had
            far-reaching ideas to make these immersive environments. Still all
            donation-based and BYOB.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think doing the parties attracted more people to the movie nights,
            which was my main goal… to get more people to see these old weird
            movies. You’d never know who was gonna show up, and that element was
            so essential. I loved meeting new people over crazy films.

              >The City of Cleveland’s tensions with The Innerspace thickened
              after its 2017 Halloween party, which Jake estimates 200+ people
              showed up to. From that point on he attempted to keep his events
              contained.
            </b>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>JAKE:</b>&emsp;Mid-January my friend was coming into town and
            wanted to DJ, so I wanted to throw something low-key for them,
            nothing too crazy. “Disco Patrol Presents: Lunar Lounge,” and that
            was our last party and the night we got raided. It was a huge
            snowstorm and I probably should have cancelled it. There was not a
            huge crowd, maybe like 50 people, but we saw the cops driving up and
            down the street before the party even started. While I was DJing and
            somebody came up to me like ‘hey there’s a cop in the building’ and
            I look and there’s a guy on the dancefloor who was so obviously an
            undercover cop. He was going around trying to buy beer. I went down
            into the basement later and there’s a buncha people standing around
            passing around a bowl, and the cops were standing right there. I
            went up to them like, hey guys, see that guy over there… like I’m
            pretty sure he’s a cop. You should probably not do that. There were
            cops parked in front with their lights on and a storm of them comes
            in, like cop after cop telling us to shut down the music and before
            we can even do anything they start unplugging stuff. This cop tells
            us ‘yeah there was a major drug deal going down in the basement’…
            That’s what they used as their excuse while they were there, saying
            there was a ‘massive cocaine deal going down in the basement.’
          </p>
          <p>
            So they rolled up all these fines, they got us on 13 different
            violations. A meeting was set up between us and Mark with the city
            councilman and the chief of police a few days later. You know
            politicians, they don’t wanna be the bad guys. They were like ‘we
            want to work with you guys, to bring you guys up to code, we
            appreciate what you’re doing in our community, we want you here, we
            just wanna make sure that everything’s above board... We don’t want
            Ghostship.’ I had gotten the worst flu and lost my voice so I
            couldn’t really state my case. What I really wanted, even if we had
            to shut down the parties, was to keep that space for movie nights.
            It wasn’t just the movie nights, we were feeding people and stuff
            too, we had free food for people for the 5 years we were there. I
            had really thought of us as a positive thing for the community. We
            didn’t want complaints from the neighbors, we didn’t want to annoy
            people in the community, we wanted it to be a good resource. But
            they were like ‘well your problem is if you open it up to the public
            with these fliers saying “everyone welcome.” If it’s a private
            thing, and it’s just your friends, you can do it.’ But it was
            essential to me to keep it open to everyone, and that’s where they
            got me. That’s what made it illegal I guess.

              Jake was optimistic that he could keep the space running as a
              nonprofit, but it would have cost thousands of dollars to get the
