            >Before opening what would eventually be known as The Innerspace,
            Jake Griswold began hosting film screenings at the Bela Dubby—an
            “almost” DIY spot/coffee shop formerly located in Lakewood. On his
            first night, sometime in January of 2010, he screened a concert film
            which he helped produce for WCSB’s Halloween Ball. The film was only
            45 minutes long, so he paired it with a punk film called Class of
            1984. These double-feature movie nights would continue monthly until
            the venue closed in 2012.</b

          I like the idea of a double feature because somebody could just wander
          in. If you’re going to a movie, the movie show time is at 8:15. You
          gotta be there at 8:15 or else you’re stuck out. But with a double
          feature, people could wander in at any time instead of the door being
          shut. I like more of a communal experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          …Around the beginning of 2013, a friend introduced me to this guy Mark
          who had just purchased this giant Vietnamese Buddhist Temple, straight
          from the group after they moved out. I told him I’d help him repair
          the spot, and yeah, we started doing movie nights there. So I helped
          him redo the ceilings, we painted all the walls white and kinda
          cleared out that space and set it up so I could project right onto the
          walls. And we did our very first event there May 1st 2013… May Day.
          And it wasn’t called the Innerspace back then. At the beginning it was
          called the People’s Temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started out showing cult movies, like literal double features about
          cults. After I ran out of cult double-features it would be like
          ‘malfunctioning robot night’ or ‘haunted house night’ or ‘girl gang
          double feature.’ Whatever different weird topics, I could pair up
          movies together that would be kinda fun. And my friend would bring a
          pizza or two to share every week, so we’d have an intermission with
          free pizza.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had a pretty nice setup, we had couches set up in there. The screen
          was very big, just having the wall painted white, it made the screen
          more immersive, having it blown up so big. Even VHS blown up that big
          looks great. The main principles of the place for me was that it was
          always going to be free—we collected donations—but no one was ever
          going to get turned away for lack of money. And everybody was welcome,
          as long as they’re friendly. I thought that would be the way of the
          future. Trying to get rid of money and stuff.

          I was very naïve that first year. Advertising was mainly done by
          making flyers, which I would make every week, print out from the radio
          station, and then go and post all over… around Gordon Square, Ohio
          City, Lakewood, I’m a west sider so mainly the west side. And the
          people who came that year were mainly people I knew. You’d look around
          at some of the more well-attended ones and it was a lot of WCSB DJs.
          But sometimes people would wander in, you’d hear people at the door
          who aren’t sure whether they’re wandering into someone’s house, not
          sure if they’re at the right place.
        </p>
        <p>
          But like I said, I was naïve and would put up fliers at places like
          the Capitol Theatre. And I soon found out that I had pissed them off
          pretty good, like this guy came in and was like ‘are you getting
          permission to show any of these films?’ And I was like, ‘well no, this
          is just a DIY thing, this isn’t an official thing. Everybody gets in
          for free, and I’m not showing Hollywood movies. These are independent
          films.’ They pointed out one movie I’d shown, this really crazy
          Japanese movie from the 70’s, they were like ‘The Cinematheque showed
          that move a couple years ago and they’re pissed.’
        </p>
        <p>
          So I started to look at everything, the Cinematheque schedules, the
          Capitol schedules, I really tried not to do any crossovers with any of
          the other theaters. They were considering calling the FCC, MGM,
          whoever. So after that I was pretty careful. But otherwise that first
          year went by pretty smoothly, we had a 6-month long run. Then I shut
          it down for the winter and went traveling like I usually do in the
          winter.

          In December 2014, musician John Elliot performed a live score to
          Trkovsky's ___??____, which played silently with the subtitles on for
          the film’s duration. Jake loved the idea of events that combined
          different artistic disciplines and saw a growing need for more
          immersive live music events in general. In particular, he was
          influenced by the disco scene he DJ’d/attended during his yearly trips
          to Mexico and South America. Him and 3 other WCSB DJs started an event
          called Disco Patrol, which began in the Mahall’s basement.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Summer of 2015, we made flyers for our first [Disco Patrol] at
          The People’s Temple, and that’s when we got our first visit from the
          city. This city inspector came and asked us about running an illegal
          movie theater. Said ‘this place is not zoned for this, you can’t be
          having events here, and we’re gonna fine you if you don’t stop doing
          it.’ So that was the first time I changed the name from the People’s
          Temple to just ‘The Temple,’ I was trying to be clever so I could
          advertise more on Facebook. We stopped doing movie nights for a while
          and moved over to 78th Street Studios to let it die down.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Prior to the city inspector’s visit] I had started having guest hosts
          and opening it up to others to do their own screenings. My dream was
          to have the space open to different community members and even have
          people come in from different countries to show movies. I just had
          these dreams—you know, we just did pizza because it was practical and
          there was no kitchen—but you know, we’d have hosts and cuisines and
          films from different countries. That was my dream for that space.
