              >Before opening what would eventually be known as The Innerspace,
              Jake Griswold began hosting film screenings at the Bela Dubby—an
              “almost” DIY spot/coffee shop formerly located in Lakewood. On his
              first night, sometime in January of 2010, he screened a concert
              film which he helped produce for WCSB’s Halloween Ball. The film
              was only 45 minutes long, so he paired it with a punk film called
              Class of 1984. These double-feature movie nights would continue
              monthly until the venue closed in 2012.</b

            I like the idea of a double feature because somebody could just
            wander in. If you’re going to a movie, the movie show time is at
            8:15. You gotta be there at 8:15 or else you’re stuck out. But with
            a double feature, people could wander in at any time instead of the
            door being shut. I like more of a communal experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            …Around the beginning of 2013, a friend introduced me to this guy
            Mark who had just purchased this giant Vietnamese Buddhist Temple,
            straight from the group after they moved out. I told him I’d help
            him repair the spot, and yeah, we started doing movie nights there.
            So I helped him redo the ceilings, we painted all the walls white
            and kinda cleared out that space and set it up so I could project
            right onto the walls. And we did our very first event there May 1st
            2013… May Day. And it wasn’t called the Innerspace back then. At the
            beginning it was called the People’s Temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started out showing cult movies, like literal double features
            about cults. After I ran out of cult double-features it would be
            like ‘malfunctioning robot night’ or ‘haunted house night’ or ‘girl
            gang double feature.’ Whatever different weird topics, I could pair
            up movies together that would be kinda fun. And my friend would
            bring a pizza or two to share every week, so we’d have an
            intermission with free pizza.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had a pretty nice setup, we had couches set up in there. The
            screen was very big, just having the wall painted white, it made the
            screen more immersive, having it blown up so big. Even VHS blown up
            that big looks great. The main principles of the place for me was
            that it was always going to be free—we collected donations—but no
            one was ever going to get turned away for lack of money. And
            everybody was welcome, as long as they’re friendly. I thought that
            would be the way of the future. Trying to get rid of money and
            stuff.

            I was very naïve that first year. Advertising was mainly done by
            making flyers, which I would make every week, print out from the
            radio station, and then go and post all over… around Gordon Square,
            Ohio City, Lakewood, I’m a west sider so mainly the west side. And
            the people who came that year were mainly people I knew. You’d look
            around at some of the more well-attended ones and it was a lot of
            WCSB DJs. But sometimes people would wander in, you’d hear people at
            the door who aren’t sure whether they’re wandering into someone’s
            house, not sure if they’re at the right place.
          </p>
          <p>
            But like I said, I was naïve and would put up fliers at places like
            the Capitol Theatre. And I soon found out that I had pissed them off
            pretty good, like this guy came in and was like ‘are you getting
            permission to show any of these films?’ And I was like, ‘well no,
            this is just a DIY thing, this isn’t an official thing. Everybody
            gets in for free, and I’m not showing Hollywood movies. These are
            independent films.’ They pointed out one movie I’d shown, this
            really crazy Japanese movie from the 70’s, they were like ‘The
            Cinematheque showed that move a couple years ago and they’re
            pissed.’
          </p>
          <p>
            So I started to look at everything, the Cinematheque schedules, the
            Capitol schedules, I really tried not to do any crossovers with any
            of the other theaters. They were considering calling the FCC, MGM,
            whoever. So after that I was pretty careful. But otherwise that
            first year went by pretty smoothly, we had a 6-month long run. Then
            I shut it down for the winter and went traveling like I usually do
            in the winter.

            In December 2014, musician John Elliot performed a live score to
            Trkovsky's ___??____, which played silently with the subtitles on
            for the film’s duration. Jake loved the idea of events that combined
            different artistic disciplines and saw a growing need for more
            immersive live music events in general. In particular, he was
            influenced by the disco scene he DJ’d/attended during his yearly
            trips to Mexico and South America. Him and 3 other WCSB DJs started
            an event called Disco Patrol, which began in the Mahall’s basement.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Summer of 2015, we made flyers for our first [Disco Patrol]
            at The People’s Temple, and that’s when we got our first visit from
            the city. This city inspector came and asked us about running an
            illegal movie theater. Said ‘this place is not zoned for this, you
            can’t be having events here, and we’re gonna fine you if you don’t
            stop doing it.’ So that was the first time I changed the name from
            the People’s Temple to just ‘The Temple,’ I was trying to be clever
            so I could advertise more on Facebook. We stopped doing movie nights
            for a while and moved over to 78th Street Studios to let it die
            down.
          </p>
          <p>
            [Prior to the city inspector’s visit] I had started having guest
            hosts and opening it up to others to do their own screenings. My
            dream was to have the space open to different community members and
            even have people come in from different countries to show movies. I
            just had these dreams—you know, we just did pizza because it was
            practical and there was no kitchen—but you know, we’d have hosts and
            cuisines and films from different countries. That was my dream for
            that space.
