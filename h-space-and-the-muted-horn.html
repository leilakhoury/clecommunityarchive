          <p>
            <b> ELI:</b>&emsp;I’m Eli Gfell. I’m a multidisciplinary artist
            first. And I’m also a carpenter and art handler, which has very much
            informed my personal practice over the years, both in skills and
            techniques, but also materials and content too. A lot of my work
            deals with finding and repurposing abandoned construction material.
            I’m super fascinated by the contemporary built environment,
            particularly this phenomenon of <i>developer modernism</i>—this idea
            of using design-y elements, but produced in a way that’s almost like
            how you’d make an iPhone… where it’s designed so that you need to
            get a new one every few years. I think the way we build things as a
            society has become really reflective of Capitalism, and everything
            that’s wrong with it, be that waste and the impact on the
            environment, privilege and equity, and access to housing. We were
            talking a little earlier about flexibility and pragmatism… You know,
            I started working in this way in art school just because there’s
            this free material everywhere. And I’ve really stuck with it because
            I see a value to it now beyond accessibility for me—the idea that
            even though it’s not quality material per se, it can have some kind
            of second life and be recontextualized.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding H Space, I always wanted a space like this to work in, but
            shortly after getting the space and starting to do work on it, I did
            see a need for more of these non-commercial and community-centered
            spaces in here in Cleveland. We had our first exhibition in 2016,
            and that was a big open-invitation group show. Over the years I’ve
            refined my curatorial approach a bit, but I’m definitely still very
            artist-focused, and that’s the core of the mission of this space.
            Even as we adapt around COVID, around this new expanded
            responsibility and accountability regarding museums and other
            institutions, at the heart of this space we’re trying to present the
            artist’s work in the way they want to present it, and not compromise
            that, and to facilitate that the best that we can. Which for me,
            usually means helping them to install the work, maybe building
            pedestals or anything they may need. I wanted to mention something
            about that—since we don’t have an operating budget or anything,
            these are all labor of love sort of things, but we can still be a
            resource in that way, in the sense that we can provide space, we can
            provide help with some of that practical stuff.

          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;I’m Kelley O’Brien, and I moved to Cleveland on
            Memorial Day Weekend of 2015. I had gone to grad school, graduated,
            traveled abroad, then came back to the U.S. like ‘what do I do with
            my life now?’ My collaborator at the time and I sat down and made an
            Excel spreadsheet of the best places in the country for young
            artists. We were looking at costs-per-square-foot...we knew we wanted
            to run a gallery, so it was really important to get some kind of
            cheap space. We were looking at opportunities to teach, so places
            with colleges that we could ideally get employed at. We were also
            looking for places with good funding for artists and opportunities
            to exhibit our work. We narrowed it down to like 8 places that
            weren’t New York or L.A. or Portland or Austin, places that are
            heavily saturated. And we decided that Cleveland was the perfect
            place for us! So we moved here sight unseen and searched for the
            ideal location that we could live and work out of. We found a
            warehouse space that had been converted into live-work apartments
            about a mile from H Space that was totally perfect for us… a big
            open living room/first floor area, then you have to walk through the
            entire house and go down this, like, compression of a stairway into
            the gallery space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we moved here, we realized how many amazing resources and
            critically minded artists there are in town. We really wanted the
            gallery to be an opportunity to engage people from around the world
            with the community of Cleveland, but also to then allow Cleveland to
            really shine and show these international artists all the great
            resources we have. Because of working at a school and having
            resources like
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://engineering.case.edu/sears-thinkbox"
              target="_blank"
              >think[box]</a
            >, there were a lot of opportunities for the artists to engage with
            local craftsmen or use really interesting 3D printers to help them
            in the production of their work. For each exhibition, we would hold
            these dinners and ask the artists to work with us to conceptually
            curate a meal that related to the work that was shown in the
            gallery, and we would invite people from Cleveland to these dinners
            who we really thought would connect with the artist’s work, so to
            give them more of a foundation in Cleveland and more people to reach
            out to.

            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;In 2019 the space was infested with mold so we
            had to move out because it was no longer a place to live. it was a
            really wonderful opportunity to re-think the role of The Muted Horn
            and what it’s goals were and how perhaps there is room for
            collaboration with Eli and H Space as a place that was working
            similarly to us. The Muted Horn focused on solo shows of young
            emerging artists, and our job was to really help them make the best
            thing possible, and it seemed like H Space had some really similar
            ideologies.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b> ELI:</b>&emsp;We definitely had similar ethos and strategies for
            operating. Also super similar timelines, which was funny. I think
            that your curatorial approach is probably more focused than mine,
            and probably more deliberate as well. And that has worked to the
            benefit of the collaboration.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;[Laughs] Well thank you. I think The Muted Horn
            was specifically interested in showing work that didn’t fit neatly
            into a box that already existed in Cleveland. If this was a show
            that could happen at a different artist-run space or gallery, if
            this was something that could happen at Forum, we didn’t want to
            show it. If this was a show for Hedge Gallery, it wasn’t right for
            us. If this was a show that could exist other places, it wasn’t a
            show for The Muted Horn. We were looking for art that was pushing
            some of the limits, things that were maybe more critical than other
            practices here in Cleveland. The Muted Horn was maybe more
            conceptually-based while the H Space was maybe more about material
            explorations and craft and the idea of making. I think The Muted
            Horn was more about research and critical conceptual thinking.

          <br />
          <p><b> ELI:</b>&emsp;I think that’s probably true.</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;I felt like by the two of us coming together and
            working, there could be some opportunities where both of our talents
            could really support each other’s interests. And perhaps end up with
            more well-rounded exhibitions that use all the resources and tools
            that we have collectively towards a better end-product. It was a
            really nice opportunity for us to think about what it might mean to
            think about material and concept all at once.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b> ELI:</b>&emsp;I really like what you said about gravitating
            towards things that can’t really exist in other spaces, or might not
            exist in other spaces. A good recent example was
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://www.matthew-gallagher.com/"
              target="_blank"
              >Matt Gallagher's show</a
            >
            here last October. It was this really immersive sound installation.
            That’s really important to me—with some of the communities that
            exist here, like the noise scene and other things like that—to
            create space for really any definition of art.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;Yeah! I think for me specifically, not coming
            from a traditional art background—my undergrad is in architecture
            and then I went to a very non-traditional graduate program. So I’ve
            never really taken an art class [laughs] or an art history class. So
            I felt that through curation, working with these artists,
            specifically thinking about the dinner and the meal component and
            how to be hospitable, there was a great opportunity for me to
            understand how artists work and talk about their research and
            creative practices. And through working closely with them, by
            preparing these dinners and installing these shows, I learned how
            they wanted their work represented. I wouldn’t have gained all those
            great skills, which translated to other aspects of my life, if it
            weren’t for sitting down with the artists and having those
            conversations. And really trying to think about all the ways to talk
            about their practice, whether it's food or experience or sound or
            tactile or visual. I’ve learned a lot about music and the noise
            scene through the exhibitions, and about different aspects of our
            communities, by really having to figure out how to articulate the
            artist’s intent.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b> ELI:</b>&emsp;I love what you said about hospitality, with the
            curated dinners, you’ve literally been hospitable for the duration
            of The Muted Horn’s existence. Just providing space and assistance
            and stuff—that’s a form of hospitality too. But I like that idea of
            taking it to that other level, a more intimate level. It’s still a
            close-knit group dinner, and there’s a lot of room there for really
            generative conversation and ideas. Moving forward, especially during
            COVID and trying to figure out how to present things in this weird
            new reality, and doing it safely without compromising people’s
            experience, the hospitality is really important there. And in a
            larger sense, just compassion too.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;Yeah, I think one of the challenging things is
            this idea of compromise. How do you present the artist’s intent and
            the artist’s desired authentically while also making sure the
            viewers are comfortable? Whether that’s through curated meals or
            thinking about the health crisis at the moment. And this is really
            important for anyone who runs a space that’s open to the public…
            it’s a challenge to think about the intent of the information
            contained within the space, and also the community’s response and
            desire to see those objects. There’s a moral/ethical responsibility
            of curators and people who run spaces to think about the safety and
            security of the audience members.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><b> ELI:</b>&emsp; Definitely.</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;And that also goes back to thinking about food
            security and feeding people, and the memories of food, and feeling
            comfortable enough in spaces to talk about art. That’s a level of
            security that goes beyond mask-wearing.

          <p>
            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;I really appreciate this discussion, especially
            how it relates to the ethical responsibilities and adaptability of
            the space. When you mentioned wanting to carve out a space for work
            that you wouldn’t find elsewhere, whether its experimental,
            interdisciplinary, critical—I got that impression from looking at
            all the past exhibits. When [Kelley and I] first started talking,
            you used the word ‘necessity’ to describe that kind of a space.
            Could you talk a little bit more about why critical art spaces are
            necessities when we’re otherwise programmed to believe that we have
            to profit off the work that we make?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;I feel torn in two different directions. As an
            artist, I like art [laughs], I enjoy producing art and talking about
            art. And I can think about reasons for the necessities of art, but
            can I think about a necessity for The Muted Horn to exist? I’m not
            so sure. I enjoyed it, I thought it was a great thing to have and I
            loved working with the artists, and I think the artists got a lot
            out of it. When we first started, we had a great response from the
            community, and there was a lot of interest and the shows were
            packed. But as the years went on that kind of teetered off. And I
            know that also as individuals working and running artist-run spaces,
            you can only put so much energy into them, because you’re operating
            on zero dollars, sometimes even in the negatives. So each of these
            shows are costing you money, they’re costing the artists money… it’s
            a labor of love, maybe not of necessity, for both the artists
            involved and the curators.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do I think it’s important to challenge the status quo or challenge
            the community’s expectations of art? Absolutely. We should always
            feel challenged in our perspectives and expectations and viewpoints
            and experiences. There’s this Scandinavian architect who talks about
            the idea of comfort as becoming unaware of your environment, and
            that discomfort is when you understand your environment to the
            fullest degree. And I think that translates to art practices, in
            thinking, or politics or criticism. If you only have people
            reaffirming your perspective, there’s no reason to change or even
            have a perspective. So I think it’s really important for everyone to
            be challenged, and to be open to people asking <i><b>why.</b></i> Do
            I think that we always respond well to those types of challenges?
            No. And if not done delicately or in the right way, they can
            detrimental, they can cause people to shut down.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think there’s a real importance of the art scene in Cleveland
            being challenged by others. I think that’s the necessity… I don’t
            think The Muted Horn itself is a necessity or that I need to run an
            alternative space. But I think it’s also important for spaces to be
            able to think outside of Capitalism in a certain way. If we’re only
            producing work that sells, we’re only producing work that’s
            agreeable. I think you’re going to get much more interesting
            exhibitions and work if you take money off the table, if there’s not
            the intention to sell or buy the work. But I think money is also
            limiting, because while we’re not interested in selling any work, I
            think we’re also incapable of funding artists, so we can’t also get
            the most critical and amazing and superb work if we can’t pay the
            artists to produce it or travel here. It’s a double-edged sword. It
            allows us some kind of freedom from compromise and freedom from
            expectations of funders, but it also is inherently limiting in who
            can make the work and who can come here to exhibit, because they
            have to pay for some of that themselves. So they have to have money
            and a car. I’m not independently wealthy, so I have to work all the
            time, and I don’t have time to write grants so I can support these
            artists and pay rent on the space. So there’s a lot of challenges
            and there’s a lot of compromises that have to be made with all these
            spaces.

          <p>
            <b> ELI:</b>&emsp;I think you summed that up really well. Regarding
            necessity, maybe it’s not necessary for specifically H Space or The
            Muted Horn to exist, but I think it’s absolutely necessary for
            alternative spaces and systems to exist. I think that’s an inherent
            part of society and humanism in some way, challenging systems and
            conventions that are in place and figuring out how else we can go
            about it in a way that serves our artists and serves us and serves
            the community.

          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;Absolutely. We have state-funded institutions,
            we have city-funded institutions, and I think there are definitely
            ways in which money seems to move and change hands between these
            different institutions
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b> ELI:</b>&emsp;Even nonprofits are still run like businesses,
            this is America, there are corporate sponsors and private donors
            behind everything.

          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp; Right… It takes passion. We’re doing this
            because we want to. But also with that, there’s maybe a
            single-mindedness behind it, like, this is YOUR space so it’s YOUR
            vision and that’s it. And I think that can be detrimental. Certain
            art spaces are run by cooperatives with multiple different people,
            and I think that’s really great because you’re getting all these
            different perspectives that are trying to come up with an idea of
            how to be run. I really think it’s important to have all of these
            different viewpoints present.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;Yes! Viewpoints and also a pooling of resources
            that makes the collaborative model work so well. Whether it’s the
            pooling of funds or skills. I agree completely.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b> ELI:</b>&emsp;And Cleveland’s great for that. We’re a small
            enough town and a close-knit enough art community that that kinda
            thing happens all the time. Having worked for the some of the
            museums and institutions locally, it even works at that level too.

            >
            is an example of that, where that sort of collaborative model
            probably wouldn’t have worked so well in most other places, just
            that fact that all those venues had relationships with each other.
            And there are places like

            that actually know and give a shit about what The Muted Horn and H
            Space are doing too.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;Yeah! One of the things that’s been so great
            about being here is that you can get the head curator of moCa to
            come to your artist-run space. You can get Fred Bidwell from FRONT
            to come. You can get the curator of photography from the CMA, a
            nationally renowned museum, to come to your exhibition, to come to
            these dinners, to speak to these artists. I think that’s been a big
            draw for a lot of our exhibiting artists, is that you can meet the
            entire arts community in one night. If you try to call the curator
            of MoMA in New York, good luck. Cleveland is a big enough
            town to have all these great things, but a small enough town where
            people still talk to each other. Alternate perspectives are
            challenged here, but also welcomed and supported in multiple
            different ways that aren’t necessarily financial.

            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;This has been an amazing discussion and I’m
            appreciative to be speaking with you both. You both have equally
            great insight. Is there anything else you’d like to add?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b> ELI:</b>&emsp;I don’t have all the answers for this—but just the
            nature of the space and the collaboration moving forward. Something that I’m personally interested in is
            everything that’s happening in the museum world right now. What H
            Space may be able to do. Not that I think we’re implicated in the
            same way, but acknowledging that there are these disparities within
            the art world and trying to come up with a way to present or give
            back to the larger community instead of just art people, I guess. Or
            people who are already sort of invested in that.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;That’s the challenge of all art spaces
            everywhere. I can walk into moCa and know everyone working there and
            be able to read the work on the walls and it’s not at all
            intimidating. I feel totally comfortable in a museum because I have
            a certain education around it, and I feel totally fine finding out
            about a random house gallery and showing up and not feeling
            uncomfortable. But my neighbors where The Muted Horn was, I’d invite
            them and they’d never come. Maybe it was the work I was showing,
            maybe it was the way I invited them, maybe they were just
            homebodies. There are so many different reasons. I think the big
            challenge of any art institution is how do you engage in a community
            in a way where they feel respected and not used, but also that they
            understand what you’re doing and why you’re doing it and how. How do
            you broaden your attendance and broaden the people who are
            interested beyond just us?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b> ELI:</b>&emsp;Especially during a time when we’re being
            discouraged from contact with one another and might have to cap our
            attendance. But I guess for me, I’m wondering what can we do as a
            physical space. Could we be collecting redistributing funds or food
            or clothing? It’s stuff that I’m considering and reckoning with,
            trying to figure out how we might be able to adapt moving forward.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;Yeah and I think we kinda mentioned this in our
            other conversation, we were basically talking about what kind of art
            is necessary right now. And I think sometimes maybe the answer is no
            art. Maybe food is more important than art. Maybe just listening and
            making friends with your neighbor is more important than seeing art
            from New Zealand.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b> ELI:</b>&emsp;It’s tricky because art is a zeitgeist too,
            obviously, it will always have importance and relevance and it
            speaks to the time in which it was created. But it’s hard to think
            about going to see some art if you can’t pay the bills or get enough
            to eat. There are obviously some more immediate, practical concerns
            that need to be address first and I certainly wouldn’t want to do
            anything to detract from that.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;I think it’s just always a juggling act. It’s
            always a balance of good intentions and necessary movement, and also
            room for freedom and expression. Maybe going and just seeing a show
            of some really beautiful sunsets is what you need at this moment.
            Just something that has nothing to do with politics.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><b> ELI:</b>&emsp;Right, it has a therapeutic aspect too.</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;I think there’s a necessity for all of it. Any
            time you exist in a space you are inherently involved in that
            community, whether your involvement is sheer rejection or total
            acceptance. You’re not operating within a bubble. So I think it’s
            also important to read your community, which I think sometimes we do
            much more successfully than others, and sometimes we get it wrong.
            Like does my community need sunsets or an open forum? But also, what
            can I actually give to my community at this moment? Maybe you can’t
            give them an open forum because it’s unsafe. What are the other
            ways?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b> ELI:</b>&emsp;There’s a certain responsibility to be conscious
            of what you’re taking too, and not using those resources when they
            can be better served to feed somebody or house somebody. Like I
            wouldn’t take any donations right now for H Space, no way. Or if I
            did I would redistribute it somewhere else. I mean I think that’s a
            big part of it too, just a personal accountability.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>KELLEY:</b>&emsp;It’s always a challenge to think about your
            responsibility, that even if you ARE doing something that’s
            community engaged, are you paying people for their intellectual
            energy to engage in this process? Are you valuing everyone’s voices
            equally? How are you supporting artists? To be aware of all of it at
            once is a huge but necessary challenge.
