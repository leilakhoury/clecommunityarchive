          <p>
            Eli: I’m Eli Gfell. I’m a multidisciplinary artist first. And I’m
            also a carpenter and art handler, which has very much informed my
            personal practice over the years, both in skills and techniques, but
            also materials and content too. A lot of my work deals with finding
            and repurposing abandoned construction material. I’m super
            fascinated by the contemporary built environment, particularly this
            phenomenon of
            <i>developer modernism</i>—this idea of using design-y elements, but
            produced in a way that’s almost like how you’d make an iPhone… where
            it’s designed so that you need to get a new one every few years. I
            think the way we build things as a society has become really
            reflective of Capitalism, and everything that’s wrong with it, be
            that waste and the impact on the environment, privilege and equity,
            and access to housing. We were talking a little earlier about
            flexibility and pragmatism… You know, I started working in this way
            in art school just because there’s this free material everywhere.
            And I’ve really stuck with it because I see a value to it now beyond
            accessibility for me—the idea that even though it’s not quality
            material per se, it can have some kind of second life and be
            recontextualized in some way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding H Space, I always wanted a space like this to work in, but
            shortly after getting the space and starting to do work on it, I did
            see a need for more of these non-commercial and community-centered
            spaces in here in Cleveland. We had our first exhibition in 2016,
            and that was a big open-invitation group show. Over the years I’ve
            refined my curatorial approach a bit, but I’m definitely still very
            artist-focused, and that’s the core of the mission of this space.
            Even as we adapt around COVID, around this new expanded
            responsibility and accountability regarding museums and other
            institutions, at the heart of this space we’re trying to present the
            artist’s work in the way they want to present it, and not compromise
            that, and to facilitate that the best that we can. Which for me,
            usually means helping them to install the work, maybe building
            pedestals or anything they may need. I wanted to mention something
            about that—since we don’t have an operating budget or anything,
            these are all labor of love sort of things, but we can still be a
            resource in that way, in the sense that we can provide space, we can
            provide help with some of that practical stuff.

          </ul>
          <p>
            Kelley: I’m Kelley O’Brien, and I moved to Cleveland on Memorial Day
            Weekend of 2015. I had gone to grad school, graduated, traveled
            abroad, then came back to the U.S. like ‘what do I do with my life
            now?’ My collaborator at the time and I sat down and made an excel
            spreadsheet of the best places in the country for young artists. We
            were looking at costs per square foot—we knew we wanted to run a
            gallery, so it was really important to get some kind of cheap space.
            We were looking at opportunities to teach, so places with colleges
            that we could ideally get employed at. We were also looking for
            places with good funding for artists and opportunities to exhibit
            our work. We narrowed it down to like 8 places that weren’t New York
            or LA or Portland or Austin, places that are heavily saturated. And
            we decided that Cleveland was the perfect place for us! So we moved
            here sight unseen and searched for the ideal location that we could
            live and work out of. We found a warehouse space that had been
            converted into live-work apartments about a mile from H Space that
            was totally perfect for us… a big open living room/first floor area,
            then you have to walk through the entire house and go down this,
            like, compression of a stairway into the gallery space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we moved here, we realized how many amazing resources and
            critically minded artists there are in town. We really wanted the
            gallery to be an opportunity to engage people from around the world
            with the community of Cleveland, but also to then allow Cleveland to
            really shine and show these international artists all the great
            resources we have. Because of working at a school and having
            resources like
            <a
              href="https://engineering.case.edu/sears-thinkbox"
              target="_blank"
              >think[box]</a
            >, there were a lot of opportunities for the artists to engage with
            local craftsmen or use really interesting 3D printers to help them
            in the production of their work. For each exhibition, we would hold
            these dinners and ask the artists to work with us to conceptually
            curate a meal that related to the work that was shown in the
            gallery, and we would invite people from Cleveland to these dinners
            who we really thought would connect with the artist’s work, so to
            give them more of a foundation in Cleveland and more people to reach
            out to.

          </ul>
          <p>
            Kelley: In 2019 the space was infested with mold so we had to move
            out because it was no longer a place to live. it was a really
            wonderful opportunity to re-think the role of The Muted Horn and
            what it’s goals were and how perhaps there is room for collaboration
            with Eli and H Space as a place that was working similarly to us.
            The Muted Horn focused on solo shows of young emerging artists, and
            our job was to really help them make the best thing possible, and it
            seemed like H Space had some really similar ideologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eli: We definitely had similar ethos and strategies for operating.
            Also super similar timelines, which was funny. I think that your
            curatorial approach is probably more focused than mine, and probably
            more deliberate as well. And that has worked to the benefit of the
            collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kelley: [Laughs] Well thank you. I think The Muted Horn was
            specifically interested in showing work that didn’t fit neatly into
            a box that already existed in Cleveland. If this was a show that
            could happen at a different artist-run space or gallery, if this was
            something that could happen at Forum, we didn’t want to show it. If
            this was a show for Hedge Gallery, it wasn’t right for us. If this
            was a show that could exist other places, it wasn’t a show for the
            Muted Horn. We were looking for art that was pushing some of the
            limits, things that were maybe more critical than other practices
            here in Cleveland. The Muted Horn was maybe more conceptually-based
            while the H Space was maybe more about material explorations and
            craft and the idea of making. I think The Muted Horn was more about
            research and critical conceptual thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eli: I think that’s probably true.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kelley: I felt like by the two of us coming together and working,
            there could be some opportunities where both of our talents could
            really support each other’s interests. And perhaps end up with more
            well-rounded exhibitions that use all the resources and tools that
            we have collectively towards a better end-product. It was a really
            nice opportunity for us to think about what it might mean to think
            about material and concept all at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eli: I really like what you said about gravitating towards things
            that can’t really exist in other spaces, or might not exist in other
            spaces. A good recent example was
            <a href="https://www.matthew-gallagher.com/" target="_blank"
              >Matt Gallagher's show</a
            >here last October. It was this really immersive sound installation.
            That’s really important to me—with some of the communities that
            exist here, like the noise scene and other things like that—to
            create space for really any definition of art.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kelley: Yeah! I think for me specifically, not coming from a
            traditional art background—my undergrad is in architecture and then
            I went to a very non-traditional graduate program. So I’ve never
            really taken an art class [laughs] or an art history class. So I
            felt that through curation, working with these artists, specifically
            thinking about the dinner and the meal component and how to be
            hospitable, there was a great opportunity for me to understand how
            artists work and talk about their research and creative practices.
            And through working closely with them, by preparing these dinners
            and installing these shows, I learned how they wanted their work
            represented. I wouldn’t have gained all those great skills, which
            translated to other aspects of my life, if it weren’t for sitting
            down with the artists and having those conversations. And really
            trying to think about all the ways to talk about their practice,
            whether its food or experience or sound or tactile or visual. I’ve
            learned a lot about music and the noise scene through the
            exhibitions, and about different aspects of our communities, by
            really having to figure out how to articulate the artist’s intent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eli: I love what you said about hospitality, with the curated
            dinners, you’ve literally been hospitable for the duration of The
            Muted Horn’s existence. Just providing space and assistance and
            stuff—that’s a form of hospitality too. But I like that idea of
            taking it to that other level, a more intimate level. It’s still a
            close-knit group dinner, and there’s a lot of room there for really
            generative conversation and ideas. Moving forward, especially during
            COVID and trying to figure out how to present things in this weird
            new reality, and doing it safely without compromising people’s
            experience, the hospitality is really important there. And in a
            larger sense, just compassion too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kelley: Yeah, I think one of the challenging things is this idea of
            compromise. How do you present the artist’s intent and the artist’s
            desired authentically while also making sure the viewers are
            comfortable? Whether that’s through curated meals or thinking about
            the health crisis at the moment. And this is really important for
            anyone who runs a space that’s open to the public… it’s a challenge
            to think about the intent of the information contained within the
            space, and also the community’s response and desire to see those
            objects. There’s a moral/ethical responsibility of curators and
            people who run spaces to think about the safety and security of the
            audience members.
          </p>
          <p>Eli: Definitely.</p>
          <p>
            Kelley: And that also goes back to thinking about food security and
            feeding people, and the memories of food, and feeling comfortable
            enough in spaces to talk about art. That’s a level of security that
            goes beyond mask-wearing.

            >
          </ul>
          <p>
            Leila: I really appreciate this discussion, especially how it
            relates to the ethical responsibilities and adaptability of the
            space. When you mentioned wanting to carve out a space for work that
            you wouldn’t find elsewhere, whether its experimental,
            interdisciplinary, critical—I got that impression from looking at
            all the past exhibits. When [Kelley and I] first started talking,
            you used the word ‘necessity’ to describe that kind of a space.
            Could you talk a little bit more about why critical art spaces are
            necessities when we’re otherwise programmed to believe that we have
            to profit off the work that we make?
          </p>
          <p>
            Kelley: I feel torn in two different directions. As an artist, I
            like art [laughs], I enjoy producing art and talking about art. And
            I can think about reasons for the necessities of art, but can I
            think about a necessity for The Muted Horn to exist? I’m not so
            sure. I enjoyed it, I thought it was a great thing to have and I
            loved working with the artists, and I think the artists got a lot
            out of it. When we first started, we had a great response from the
            community, and there was a lot of interest and the shows were
            packed. But as the years went on that kind of teetered off. And I
            know that also as individuals working and running artist-run spaces,
            you can only put so much energy into them, because you’re operating
            on zero dollars, sometimes even in the negatives. So each of these
            shows are costing you money, they’re costing the artists money… it’s
            a labor of love, maybe not of necessity, for both the artists
            involved and the curators.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do I think it’s important to challenge the status quo or challenge
            the community’s expectations of art? Absolutely. We should always
            feel challenged in our perspectives and expectations and viewpoints
            and experiences. There’s this Scandinavian architect who talks about
            the idea of comfort as becoming unaware of your environment, and
            that discomfort is when you understand your environment to the
            fullest degree. And I think that translates to art practices, in
            thinking, or politics or criticism. If you only have people
            reaffirming your perspective, there’s no reason to change or even
            have a perspective. So I think it’s really important for everyone to
            be challenged, and to be open to people asking <i><b>why.</b></i> Do
            I think that we always respond well to those types of challenges?
            No. And if not done delicately or in the right way, they can
            detrimental, they can cause people to shut down.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think there’s a real importance of the art scene in Cleveland
            being challenged by others. I think that’s the necessity… I don’t
            think The Muted Horn itself is a necessity or that I need to run an
            alternative space. But I think it’s also important for spaces to be
            able to think outside of Capitalism in a certain way. If we’re only
            producing work that sells, we’re only producing work that’s
            agreeable. I think you’re going to get much more interesting
            exhibitions and work if you take money off the table, if there’s not
            the intention to sell or buy the work. But I think money is also
            limiting, because while we’re not interested in selling any work, I
            think we’re also incapable of funding artists, so we can’t also get
            the most critical and amazing and superb work if we can’t pay the
            artists to produce it or travel here. It’s a double-edged sword. It
            allows us some kind of freedom from compromise and freedom from
            expectations of funders, but it also is inherently limiting in who
            can make the work and who can come here to exhibit, because they
            have to pay for some of that themselves. So they have to have money
            and a car. I’m not independently wealthy, so I have to work all the
            time, and I don’t have time to write grants so I can support these
            artists and pay rent on the space. So there’s a lot of challenges
            and there’s a lot of compromises that have to be made with all these
            spaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eli: I think you summed that up really well. Regarding necessity,
            maybe it’s not necessary for specifically H Space or The Muted Horn
            to exist, but I think it’s absolutely necessary for alternative
            spaces and systems to exist. I think that’s an inherent part of
            society and humanism in some way, challenging systems and
            conventions that are in place and figuring out how else we can go
            about it in a way that serves our artists and serves us and serves
            the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kelley: Absolutely. We have state-funded institutions, we have
            city-funded institutions, and I think there are definitely ways in
            which money seems to move and change hands between these different
            institutions
          </p>
          <p>
            Eli: Even nonprofits are still run like businesses, this is America,
            there are corporate sponsors and private donors behind everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kelley: Right… It takes passion. We’re doing this because we want
            to. But also with that, there’s maybe a single-mindedness behind it,
            like, this is YOUR space so it’s YOUR vision and that’s it. And I
            think that can be detrimental. Certain art spaces are run by
            cooperatives with multiple different people, and I think that’s
            really great because you’re getting all these different perspectives
            that are trying to come up with an idea of how to be run. I really
            think it’s important to have all of these different viewpoints
            present.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leila: Yes! Viewpoints and also a pooling of resources that makes
            the collaborative model work so well. Whether it’s the pooling of
            funds or skills. I agree completely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eli: And Cleveland’s great for that. We’re a small enough town and a
            close-knit enough art community that that kinda thing happens all
            the time. Having worked for the some of the museums and institutions
            locally, it even works at that level too.
            <a href="https://frontart.org/" target="_blank">FRONT</a>is an
            example of that, where that sort of collaborative model probably
            wouldn’t have worked so well in most other places, just that fact
            that all those venues had relationships with each other. And there
            are places like
            <a href="https://www.spacescle.org/" target="_blank">SPACES</a>that
            actually know and give a shit about what The Muted Horn and H Space
            are doing too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kelley: Yeah! One of the things that’s been so great about being
            here is that you can get the head curator of MOCA to come to your
            artist-run space. You can get Fred Bidwell from FRONT to come. You
            can get the curator of photography from the CMA, a nationally
            renowned museum, to come to your exhibition, to come to these
            dinners, to speak to these artists. I think that’s been a big draw
            for a lot of our exhibiting artists, is that you can meet the entire
            arts community in one night. If you try to call the curator of MoMA
            in New York, good luck. [laughs] Cleveland is a big enough town to
            have all these great things, but a small enough town where people
            still talk to each other. Alternate perspectives are challenged
            here, but also welcomed and supported in multiple different ways
            that aren’t necessarily financial.

          <p>
            Leila: This has been an amazing discussion and I’m appreciative to
            be speaking with you both. You both have equally great insight. Is
            there anything else you’d like to add?
          </p>
          <p>
            Eli: I don’ have all the answers for this—but just the nature of the
            space and the collaboration moving forward [due to COVID.] And
            something that I’m personally interested in is everything that’s
            happening in the museum world right now. What H Space may be able to
            do. Not that I think we’re implicated in the same way, but
            acknowledging that there are these disparities within the art world
            and trying to come up with a way to present or give back to the
            larger community instead of just art people, I guess. Or people who
            are already sort of invested in that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kelley: That’s the challenge of all art spaces everywhere. I can
            walk into MOCA and know everyone working there and be able to read
            the work on the walls and it’s not at all intimidating. I feel
            totally comfortable in a museum because I have a certain education
            around it, and I feel totally fine finding out about a random house
            gallery and showing up and not feeling uncomfortable. But my
            neighbors where The Muted Horn was, I’d invite them and they’d never
            come. Maybe it was the work I was showing, maybe it was the way I
            invited them, maybe they were just homebodies. There are so many
            different reasons. I think the big challenge of any art institution
            is how do you engage in a community in a way where they feel
            respected and not used, but also that they understand what you’re
            doing and why you’re doing it and how. How do you broaden your
            attendance and broaden the people who are interested beyond just us?
          </p>
          <p>
            Eli: Especially during a time when we’re being discouraged from
            contact with one another and might have to cap our attendance. But I
            guess for me, I’m wondering what can we do as a physical space.
            Could we be collecting redistributing funds or food or clothing?
            It’s stuff that I’m considering and reckoning with, trying to figure
            out how we might be able to adapt moving forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kelley: Yeah and I think we kinda mentioned this in our other
            conversation, we were basically talking about what kind of art is
            necessary right now. And I think sometimes maybe the answer is no
            art. Maybe food is more important than art. Maybe just listening and
            making friends with your neighbor is more important than seeing art
            from New Zealand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eli: It’s tricky because art is a zeitgeist too, obviously, it will
            always have importance and relevance and it speaks to the time in
            which it was created. But it’s hard to think about going to see some
            art if you can’t pay the bills or get enough to eat. There are
            obviously some more immediate, practical concerns that need to be
            address first and I certainly wouldn’t want to do anything to
            detract from that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kelley: I think it’s just always a juggling act. It’s always a
            balance of good intentions and necessary movement, and also room for
            freedom and expression. Maybe going and just seeing a show of some
            really beautiful sunsets is what you need at this moment. Just
            something that has nothing to do with politics.
          </p>
          <p>Eli: Right, it has a therapeutic aspect too.</p>
          <p>
            Kelley: I think there’s a necessity for all of it. Any time you
            exist in a space you are inherently involved in that community,
            whether your involvement is sheer rejection or total acceptance.
            You’re not operating within a bubble. So I think it’s also important
            to read your community, which I think sometimes we do much more
            successfully than others, and sometimes we get it wrong. Like does
            my community need sunsets or an open forum? But also, what can I
            actually give to my community at this moment? Maybe you can’t give
            them an open forum because it’s unsafe. What are the other ways?
          </p>
          <p>
            Eli: There’s a certain responsibility to be conscious of what you’re
            taking too, and not using those resources when they can be better
            served to feed somebody or house somebody. Like I wouldn’t take any
            donations right now for H Space, no way. Or if I did I would
            redistribute it somewhere else. I mean I think that’s a big part of
            it too, just a personal accountability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kelley: It’s always a challenge to think about your responsibility,
            that even if you ARE doing something that’s community engaged, are
            you paying people for their intellectual energy to engage in this
            process? Are you valuing everyone’s voices equally? How are you
            supporting artists? To be aware of all of it at once is a huge but
            necessary challenge.
