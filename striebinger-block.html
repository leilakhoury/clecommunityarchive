          <br /><br />
          <p>
            <b>LINDA:</b>&emsp; I first learned about the Center when I opened a
            gay and lesbian bookstore called Another State of Mind in Lakewood
            in 1987. Before that, I had been peripherally involved with the gay
            community in Cleveland. The bookstore also had a place for people to
            come and sit. We had a store cat and we had coffee brewing all the
            time. If somebody wanted to come in and browse and look around, and
            then wanted to sit and talk, that option was available. And so it
            almost became like a mini-hotline for people, who could come in and
            just have other lesbians to talk to or gay men to talk to.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then we started getting phone calls. I found out that the
            Lesbian/Gay Community Center had a hotline at the time, and most of
            the men weren’t comfortable talking to the lesbians. So they would
            send the lesbians to me at the bookstore. And I couldn’t understand
            why I was getting all these calls, saying things like, “Can I just
            talk to you?” or “Here’s what going on.” I went over and spoke with
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="http://catalog.wrhs.org/collections/view?docId=ead/MS5026.xml;chunk.id=headerlink;brand=default;query=aubrey%20wertheim"
              target="_blank"
              >Aubrey Wertheim,</a
            >
            who was the senior staff person at the time. We talked about trying
            to do some training for the guys on the hotline, and I just finally
            said, “Ok, this is fine, have women call me if they need to talk.
            This is just something I care about, I’ll continue to do that, if
            that’s how it’s gonna work.”
          </p>
          <p>
            With more dialogue, Aubrey invited me to be on the board of the
            Center, so I joined the board in 1987. And at that time, Aubrey was
            the director there and I think they may have had a couple other
            part-time staffers. So my partner and I moved to Nashville in ’89
            because she got a job there. And then in ’93 we came back, and I
            called the current executive director of the center, Judy Rainbrook,
            who had been the board chair when I was on the board. And I said,
            “Hey, I’m back in town looking for a job in office management,” or
            whatever, and she said, “When can you start?” and so I came in as an
            administrative assistant in late-’93.

  <big><i>Service and Outreach</i></big>
</ul>
<br />
          <p><b>LINDA:</b>&emsp;
            At that time, we had a youth program called PRYSM (Presence and
            Respect for Youth in Sexual Minority) that met every Saturday. It
            was an all-volunteer-run program, and the volunteers were incredibly
            dedicated to these kids. They were dedicated to being there for
            them, and to trying to help them through this struggle, because this
            was still a very dangerous time to be gay. And certainly, most
            people were not out. We had the youth program, we still had the
            hotline, and we had a part-time staff person who womanned that
            program. We started The Living Room sometime between 1993-1995. The
            Living Room was a drop-in space for men with HIV, or men just
            needing a place to talk about how to maneuver safely in this new
            world. We were able to rent the storefront next to the main center
            was (the main center had two storefronts), so we added the third,
            and that was The Livingroom. And that was started by Aubrey and
            Jimmy Amato, who was HIV+. And it became this incredible resource
            and support system for men living with HIV and AIDS.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to that, we did outreach. We did safe sex outreach in
            the bars, in the parks, anywhere we could go to get to guys. We’d
            give out safe sex information, explain how to get tested, hand out
            condoms, and did anything we could do to try to educate the
            community. We also worked with a lot of groups in the city; there
            were leather groups, there was a country western dance group, there
            was the
            <a

              >G.I.F.T. Cruise,</a
            >
            which was a yearly fundraiser cruise on the river,
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://www.nabwmt.org/about-us/"
              target="_blank"
              >Black and White Men Together,</a
            >
            we just worked with any group that would work with us to spread the
            word about safe sex. And also to spread the word that we were a
            resource for them via the hotline. We also had men’s support
            groups—I think it was just men at that point. There may have been a
            mixed group for men and women. At that point in time, the lesbian
            community was centered on the east side around Cleveland Heights. So
            a lot of the support groups for Lesbians were held there.

  <big><i>Space to Grow</i></big>
</ul>
<br />
          <p><b>LINDA:</b>&emsp;
            In 1996, Judy Rainbrook resigned, and I was appointed the executive
            director. At that point, we had a full-time staff person for The
            Livingroom, full-time staff person for the youth group, and then I
            added a marketing and PR person so that we could begin to get the
            word out to both donors and constituents, anyone who needed us. We
            had a really robust fundraising program, we had people who knew what
            they were doing in fundraising, and I was mentored so well by those
            folks. The Center was funded purely through donations, because at
            that point, there was no government money and no other revenue. So
            in ’97 or ’98, we started a capital campaign to move out of that
            building. It had its problems. First of all, have you been in that
            building?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;I've only seen it from outside.</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>LINDA:</b>&emsp;It was this old building. Every door you went in
            was on a different level. You’d walk in here—and there’s two steps
            down—here there’s another step to go up here—if you want to go from
            storefront to storefront, there’s two steps down—onto a landing—two
            steps up. <i>It was totally not accessible.</i> I think you could get a
            wheelchair through the front door to get into the conference room
            where the groups met. But that was it, it was just totally not
            accessible. And the housing above us—there were issues with those
            folks. They weren’t bad people, but they’d start to run a bath and
            leave the water running. I can’t tell you how many times we came in
            to have our desks, computers, and printers full of water. It
            actually got to the point where everybody covered their desks in
            plastic before they left at night. We knew we had to get out of
            there. And another thing—it didn’t have air conditioning. There was
            like one room where you had air coming in through windows, but the
            rest of it was just stifling.
          </p>
          <p>
            We started a capital campaign to raise money, and in 2000, we moved
            to Gordon Square. We basically raised money to renovate a space that
            was mostly in the lower floors, and most below-ground. The
            storefront that you entered through had big windows and that was
            open, but it was mostly below-ground. A lot of people in the
            community didn’t like that, but the rent, the lease for that was so
            cheap because Gordon Square wanted us to renovate that space. It
            really kept us alive in the lean times after that. Some people have
            sad that was a mistake, and I’ll stand by that decision to do that,
            because I knew what the finances were like.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we moved there, we had four or five times as much space. We had
            offices and I think five different sized meeting rooms. We had a
            resource center with pamphlets and flyers and safe sex information.
            We had started a safe schools project,

            (Gay Lesbian & Straight Education Network), which was a program to
            work with teachers and kids in school to help with bullying. It was
            a great program. We had complete community outreach program around
            AIDS and other STDs. That seems to me to be the most of what we did
            at that point. I was a director until 2002.

            <b>LEILA:</b>&emsp;From what I understand, there are very early
            roots of Pride beginning at the Center around 1988, correct?

          <br />
          <p>
            <b>LINDA:</b>&emsp;Yes, I organized it—we called it a business fair,
            I believe. We invited gay businesses, groups, and organizations to
            come and set up in the kind of alley behind the center. It connected
            to Man’s World there, and then of course connected to the Center. We
            invited the public to come in and see what was being offered out
            there. I wanted to do this because I wanted people to know about my
            bookstore, so I had a table with books and cards and things like
            that. I don’t know if that was the earliest Pride, I think there was
            something earlier than that. I saw you had a piece on the 1990
            Pride. We didn’t march then, it was more of a business fair. But I
            think the next year it did spawn into more of a gay pride
            celebration.
