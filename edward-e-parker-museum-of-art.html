          <p>
            <b>LEILA:&emsp;</b>Would you like to start by talking about your
            artistic practice and your background in art?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>ED:&emsp;</b>My background in art is many things. I started art
            in the fourth grade. I had difficulties with the three R’s: Reading,
            writing, and arithmetic. I had a teacher who thought I had a talent
            so she called my parents and asked if she could pay my way to the
            Toledo Museum of Art. So she did, and that was the start of my
            career. After the first year there, my parents took it up and
            started sending me every year, so I went to take classes at the
            Toledo Museum of Art, and started in the fourth grade and finished
            in the 8th or 9th grade. Toledo Museum of Art is the third
            wealthiest museum in the country; New York is first, Cleveland is
            second, Toledo is third, and I thought that was interesting. So my
            career started when I was in the fourth grade and ended when I was
            in ninth grade, going to art school every Saturday morning.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also a professor at the Western Campus of Cuyahoga Community
            College, I ran the sculpture and ceramics department. I was there a
            long time. It was a nice experience. I taught sculpture, ceramics,
            design, drawing. During that time I taught a little bit of
            everything because I knew the cut back was coming and I wanted to be
            able to teach things other than sculpture and ceramics.
          </p>

          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>ED:&emsp;</b>I guess I was at the Western Campus fifteen or
            twenty years. During that time I started making plans to retire, and
            I bought this building for my retirement years. This building had
            sat empty for twenty years, and it took a crazy young artist to come
            and redo it. I remember when I first started working on it, my
            friend had said ‘that building is going to kill him,’ and that’s
            what I was praying for, just don’t let me die in the building. I
            tried to borrow money, wouldn’t nobody let me borrow money, no bank.
            And now they trying to throw me down and make me take money. So all
            praises go to the heavenly father, God.
          </p>
          <p>
            The front of the building used to be the East Cleveland Clinic that
            worked in conjunction with Huron Road Hospital, and it was designed
            for the wealthy alcoholics. Downstairs in my workspace you can see
            room spaces that have a call light above. And since I’ve been in
            here I’ve had various people come back, people that used to work
            here when it was the Clinic. There’s information on when it first
            became empty—as the saying goes, the gentleman who ran the clinic
            fell in love with somebody else and ran away with the new
            girlfriend. His wife tried to take it over, but couldn’t manage it.
            When they moved out, people tried to make it work but couldn’t. It
            was a church at one time, some minister just walked in off the
            street and set up his practice in here, but he couldn’t make it
            work. I talked to him years ago. I’ve had people come back who had
            family that worked here before it became a nursing home, whose
            families were buried down the street in Lakeview Cemetery.

            <b>ED:&emsp;</b>It’s hard work, but it’s working. And this pandemic
            has put a halt to a lot of things, but I still have students come
            here. I give free classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays to senior
            citizens. So this building evolved from day one. I’ve had three
            apartments in here for rent, my studio is in the lower level, we
            have a hair salon here, we have a bookstore here, and we have my art
            museum here. So I’m just excited. I might not act like it, but I
            really am [laughs].

            This past summer, we had a lady rent it out for SOS—<a

              >Strengthening Our Students</a
            >—she hired a guy to teach young kids to make comic books. People
            gave me money to do art classes for grandparents and grandkids, that
            went well. We had an art exhibit for that. The list goes on and on.
            Cleveland Foundation gave me the money to do the intergenerational
            art class.

          <p>
            <b>LEILA:&emsp;</b>And you still make time to produce art of your
            own, too.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>ED:&emsp;</b>Absolutely, that’s what it was designed for! For
            when I retire. To be able to come over in distant times and create
            till tomorrow’s end. That’s what I wanna do.

			I wrote that when I was flying back from Africa. I was fortunate enough to
            study in Africa, and it was a mind-blowing experience. I studied in
            the Western countries, for the longest period of time. Nigeria;
            Lagos, Abeokuta, Ife, those places.

          </p>
          <p><br/>
            <b>ED:&emsp;</b>In a lot of cultures, art comes first. That’s what
            we have to start thinking about here. Put art first, and we won’t a

            Parker's Guesthouse [the building next door, which Edward converted into a bed & breakfast] has been running about ten-fifteen years now. Which again, is doing
            extremely well. I’ve had people from all over the world; Japan,
            China, Africa, you may have heard of

              >Parade the Circle?</a
            >
            Behind the Museum, in that space next to the bed and breakfast, they
            would rent that space for their float-making. Most of them were from
            Africa. It was a fantastic experience, there were about ten of them,
            and everyday they woke up singing, working, carving, go over there
            and do their floats for the Parade the Circle. I’ve been fortunate
            enough to have some communication with the Cleveland Museum of Art,
            I’ve had the director here looking to see what I was doing, which I
            was extremely proud of. I tried to get ‘em to buy my Chicken George.
            We need some place for Chicken George, some prominent place.

          <p>
            Chicken George was written by Alex Haley for his <i>Roots</i> series. I am
            a theme artist and that was a theme of mine during that period of
            time. Chicken George started it all, I mean he made a living through
            fighting his chickens. So Alex Haley, who was a writer who did the
            story of Chicken George—incidentally though one of the ladies who
            wrote the play was from Cleveland. I had a chance to speak to Alex
            Haley, him and Norman Leer, they were gonna use my work in the
            program, but he passed. You gotta be lucky, timely, to become
            successful in this business.

            In my short life, I’ve done over 3,000 pieces. I’ve got artwork all
            over everywhere. Thank God. I’ve had all kinds of meetings here.
            We’ve done jazz in here, we’ve had parties in here, we’ve had
            weddings in here. We had our annual

            This was the first year we didn’t do the Collard Greens Fest. We
            give money to who cooks the best collard greens—first, second, and
            third place prizes. I used to win, by the way, and then they said it
            was not fair [laughs]. I had outside judges come in and judge. I
            give away a $500 art scholarship to a budding art student. This
            would have been the 15th year, but the pandemic slowed all that
            down. But we’re gonna get through this also. I don’t know when. But
            we will get through this.

            <b>ED:&emsp;</b>Yes. We gotta get rid of that current president! And
            people should come by here and see what’s happening, because they’ll
            be amazed to see how this building has transformed from an eyesore
            to a nice thing. Everyone has an invitation to come and see what we
